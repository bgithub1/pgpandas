dothan,https://okaloosa.craigslist.org/cto/d/1981-bmw-320i-e21/6483882172.html,"I searched for nearly a year before finding a car that I thought I could restore and drive for the rest of my life and maybe even pass along. But life happens and I need to move on. It has about 180,000 miles, is driven every day to Eglin and back. Never let me down. I bought it three years ago from the second owner. It needed some maintenance, but looked great. So I bought it and changed all the maintenance usuals - hoses, belts, thermostat, oxygen sensor, fuel filter, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotor. Then changed out the radiator, replaced the dashboard lights that were out, changed out the old radio and couple of speakers. Bought a sport steering wheel, got a used turn signal stalk so the brights would work, cleaned the grounds and changed bulbs so the lights would work, changed some gaskets and fuses, in other words got it daily driver ready. And for three years I have driven it.\n\nLast summer I did the whole front end - H&R springs, Sachs shocks and struts, new control arms, tie rods, bushings, calipers, rotors, pads, hoses. Ran out of time to get the back done. It drives much better now. Go kart like. Brand new tires about two months ago and the alignment helped too. I have a huge box with more parts that I have collected - wheel bearings, A/C stuff, shifter stuff, hoses, water pump, and more that goes with it. I think I've gotten it to the point where someone can come in and finish what I've started. I also have the factory service manual, though You Tube videos are the better route IMO.\n\nLet's talk about rust. It's originally a California car, but it does have some - bottom of the doors where I guess a drain hole might have been plugged, in the trunk. To tackle that, I have POR-15, their epoxy and mat fiber, spray of the correct color, and clear. But my thought was first do the mechanicals. It looks good now, but that's on next summer's list if I still have it.\n\nInterior's pretty good for it's age. Seats are great except the driver's has split. I have foam to rebuild the base and was going to get new skins, but you can do that. Dash is cracked like almost every other 80's car. A/C is all there and I have o rings and a receiver dryer. As I said, next summer's list. This was a long term, hold until car for me. Just don't have the time or money to keep it right now. If I win the lottery, that will certainly change.\n\nI would consider trades, (maybe I can talk my wife into something interesting - Miata, Mini Cooper, other old BMW, VW and the like) yeah I know, but I can dream, and I'll listen politely to offers. You can have a different idea of what it's worth. I have mine. And I know you never get back what you put into it. Total the cost of the parts already on it and the ones that go with it. I think the price is fair. But be polite and I'll listen.\n\nBut no, I don't need help selling it and I'm not shipping it to Dubai or wherever. Any questions, I'll try to answer."

Hoping someone out there will be able to take it and restore it to it's formal glory.\n\nI haven't tried cranking the car in years so not sure how much work will need to be done to engine. It doesn't have any major leaks. All the glass is in good shape. As you can see in pictures the paint has faded and begun to peel in several places and there are a few areas with rust beginning to show. Dash is intact but has several cracks. If someone was wanting a 2002 project car this would be a great start.\n\nAsking $5,000. Not interested in any trades. Located in Florence Alabama.\n\nI'll be happy to answer questions."

gadsden-anniston,https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/d/bmw-324d-rare-imported-diesel/6490758064.html,"For sale is a used manual Euro 1986/1987 BMW 324D (12/1986 manufacture date). This is one of the first years the that most famous model BMW made, the E30, was made with a diesel engine. It has the BMW M21 diesel engine (this is not the turbo engine). If you Google best diesel engines and do your research, this will come up as one of the best. We imported the car from Europe and are the third owners. The first was a lady in Germany, and the second was a couple in the Netherlands. For a diesel that is a baby. The car is my daily driver. I only drive 12 miles each way to work. The car starts perfectly and there is never a concern with any problems. It gets about 33 or 34 miles per gallon. The only reason we are selling it is because we are moving to a place with a dirt road. I have a clear Georgia title in hand!\n\nThe Good: The mileage is in kilos and from my gas logs they are approximate. The car has 167,882 kilos (approximately 105,00 miles!!). Remember 0.62 miles = 1 kilo.\n\n03/2015: New front rotors, back rotors turned, new front and back brake pads, transmission fluid changes, new fuel filter, and new brake fluid. Mileage was 158712 kilos.\n\n04/2016: New lifetime Mishimoto radiator, new fan, new fan clutch, new belts, new glow plugs, new glow plug fuse, new water pump, new mats, and new K & N lifetime air filter. The thermostat was changed in 04/16 also. The original thermostat for the car runs at the 3/4 spot (remember it is cold in Europe so the car runs hotter) so it was changed to the 524td (American) thermostat which has the needle at half.Mileage was 161272 kilos.\n\n06/16: New Garagistic shift bushings. Mileage was 162621 kilos.\n\n09/16: Style 10 rims professionally refinished and new tires. Mileage was 163530 kilos.\n\nThe Bad -The car is over 30 years old and has some minor issues with some small spots on the body that need to be treated. I think the clear coat may have worn as it is hard to get stains from leaves off. Nothing major. I had planned to take it to Maaco to refresh it, take care of the small spots, and get a new clear coat but never got to it. -This a Euro car. It does not have air conditioning.\n-When the car is cold the brake light comes on. When it warms up the light goes off. Research shows that this is a common problem and has to do with the solder on the connection. I have never had the time to do this project. But there is a youtube video that walks you through this if that is a problem for you.\n-The lower seat heater and the power antennae do not work. I had replaced the antennae when i first got the car but those things don't hold up for long.\n-Parts can be challenging to get but I have a c.d. that dealers use. You put in the VIN and it gives you the part numbers. This helps find parts easier. Some parts are available in the U.S. because of the Amercian available 524TD. It used the same engine. But others have to be found on Ebay or searching the internet and most of the time come from England or Germany.\n\nPlease email any questions. No Shipping is available. You must make arrangements to pick the vehicle up in Saint Marys, Georgia. The listed price is my lowest acceptable price. Thanks for looking."

This car has only 98,267 Original Miles, 2nd Owner, Kameleon Custom Paint including door jams, trunk, & motor compartment. Absolutely no body damage on this vehicle. Painted only because original Schwarz black paint had been polished so much over the years it needed paint on it. Every time I drove it, I always wanted to polish it so I changed the color. I personally painted this car myself, I am a professional of 33 years and have owned this vehicle since 12/13/1997. It is my baby and only drive it on nice days, never in the rain unless I get caught out in it, and garage kept. I painted it about 8 years ago and is in excellent condition. Interior is in excellent condition except slight wear on drivers seat where you get in and out. Top is in excellent shape, I replaced at the same time as painting with BMW original equipment. Custom 17"" Alba Alloy wheels with low profile Falken tires with excellent tread. I also have the original wheels and original stereo if you want them. It has a aftermarket Kenwood stereo with cassette with a 10 cd changer in the trunk along with a bazooka bass and small amp. It has the tool kit in the trunk and still has all the original tools in it, and has never been used. This vehicle has always been adult driven, Inline 6, 5 speed manual. Timing belt was done at 50k. Glass is good, headlights are not chipped, metal bumpers are in excellent condition, all moldings and rubber around windows are excellent.\nPictures doesn't do the Kameleon paint any justice but predominate colors are green to purple and in between colors, more noticeable at low sun are blue, copper, maroon, and gold/chartreuse. At a distance it can look black. This vehicle is very classy and sporty, and I don't see anyone having one any nicer than this one - it turns heads everywhere you go so if you don't like people looking at you or talking to people then this isn't the vehicle for you. I have it insured through Grundy Collector Vehicle Insurance for 15k. I have the original listing taken off the window from BMW to Village BMW in Chattanooga, TN showing all the features and the total suggested retail price new was $34,340.00. Asking $6900.00"

I installed the camber and toe tabs so the car could be aligned properly but never got around to it\n- There is no exhaust on the car currently. It is just open headers.\n\nI'm sure there is more that I'm forgetting but I will add as I remember.

Obd1 M50 swap was done by a previous owner and runs perfectly now that i've Replaced a few key relays, as well as cleaned the MAF and ICV(a pain but worth the perfect idle)....

gadsden-anniston,https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/d/1987-bmw-e28-535i-manual-5/6484391168.html,"I purchased this car early this year from the fourth owner who is a doctor in New York. The second owner of this vehicle was a BMW master mechanic who basically did most of the modifications and repairs on this car about 7 years /36k miles ago. The third owner was a BMW collector in Florida who has many older vintage bmws so he sold this one. The chassis and body have somewhere around 200k miles on it from what the carfax shows me, but there has been a lot of work done to the car before I purchased it, and they follow here:\n\nEngine:\nRebuilt 36k miles/ 8-9 years ago by 2nd owner who was the bmw master tech, I have most the parts purchased receipts for this\nComplete head rework with aftermarket valve springs, valve retainers, and schrick cams\nNew piston rings, rod and crank bearings, head gasket, engine seals, alternator\nConverted to MAF with miller motorsports maf and WAR chip\nExhaust:\nFull Supersprint exhaust and headers\nAdditional Parts:\nclutch and flywheel\nfan clutch and radiator\ndriveshaft\nfuel pump and regulator\nslave and master cylinder\nFront End:\nupper and lower control arms\nsway and steering bar links\nSuspension\nH&R Springs with Bilstein damper\nBody:\nDiamond black metallic paint job about 9 years (Car was Sapphire blue metallic originally I think)\nNew door and trunk rubber seals\nEuropean Front valance\nEuropean Spec front and rear bumper\nEuro headlights and fog lights\nE28 M5 shadowline door trim\nInterior:\nEuro M5 leather dashboard (I think its started to crack under the leather)\nReupholstered leather front power sport and back seats\nNew alcantra headliner\nM dash cluster\nM metal pedal box and shift knob\nKenwood headunit with bluetooth and new front speakers\nNew front driver window motor\n\nNow the cons that the local BMW shop informed me of:\nSome rust on the shocks and front thrust arms of the car,\npower steering hoses and filters will need to be changed in the near future\nDiff gasket, Oil pan and filter gasket will be need replacement in the near future (gasket is saturating a little, not dripping yet).\nWill need new tires (current tires are bald and dry rotting),\nNew A/C switch and A/C recharge, blows cool air not cold, and witch only stays on sometimes\nInterior trim under steering wheel is drooping\nMissing clips to hold in trunk liner\nFinally passenger window is not working\n\nI did many reliability repairs when I purchased the car because I originally planned to daily drive it. I had the following replaced early this year and only drove a few hundred miles since:\nbattery\nspark plugs\nnew distributor cap and rotor\nnew water pump, new belts and new hoses\nnew coolant temperature sensor\nnew shift link seal\nnew valve cover gasket and valve adjustment\nChanged almost all the lights and put in new seals\nInstalled a refurbished computer board for the dash.\nFinally got a new tune from Markert Motorwerks for the WAR chip.\nAll the work I got done was done by Market which is a local BMW specialist shop. I have all the paperwork for this recent work and some for work done by the previous owners. Car currently has about 38K miles and about 9 years on most the rebuild.\n\nI am selling because plans changed, I need to drive further and more for work and school now. So I purchased a newer automatic car to daily drive, and I do not wish to insure and drive 2 cars so I am selling this one. The car mechanically runs and drives great now, except for the bads but everything else should last a long time. The interior id say is a 7-8/10 condition for a 25yr old car due to the some of the buttons having wear, carpets have wear. Exterior Id say is 6/10. Looks great from 5-10feet away but upon closer inspection there are some small scratches, dents and micro scratches. Probably could be a 7-8/10 with a good polish job. Please let me know if you are interested or have any more questions or if you would like more photos because I have many more."

But life happens and I need to move on. It has about 180,000 miles, is driven every day to Eglin and back. Never let me down. I bought it three years ago from the second owner. It needed some maintenance, but looked great. So I bought it and changed all the maintenance usuals - hoses, belts, thermostat, oxygen sensor, fuel filter, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotor. Then changed out the radiator, replaced the dashboard lights that were out, changed out the old radio and couple of speakers. Bought a sport steering wheel, got a used turn signal stalk so the brights would work, cleaned the grounds and changed bulbs so the lights would work, changed some gaskets and fuses, in other words got it daily driver ready. And for three years I have driven it.\n\nLast summer I did the whole front end - H&R springs, Sachs shocks and struts, new control arms, tie rods, bushings, calipers, rotors, pads, hoses. Ran out of time to get the back done. It drives much better now. Go kart like. Brand new tires about two months ago and the alignment helped too. I have a huge box with more parts that I have collected - wheel bearings, A/C stuff, shifter stuff, hoses, water pump, and more that goes with it. I think I've gotten it to the point where someone can come in and finish what I've started. I also have the factory service manual, though You Tube videos are the better route IMO.\n\nLet's talk about rust. It's originally a California car, but it does have some - bottom of the doors where I guess a drain hole might have been plugged, in the trunk. To tackle that, I have POR-15, their epoxy and mat fiber, spray of the correct color, and clear. But my thought was first do the mechanicals. It looks good now, but that's on next summer's list if I still have it.\n\nInterior's pretty good for it's age. Seats are great except the driver's has split. I have foam to rebuild the base and was going to get new skins, but you can do that. Dash is cracked like almost every other 80's car. A/C is all there and I have o rings and a receiver dryer. As I said, next summer's list. This was a long term, hold until car for me. Just don't have the time or money to keep it right now. If I win the lottery, that will certainly change.\n\nI would consider trades, (maybe I can talk my wife into something interesting - Miata, Mini Cooper, other old BMW, VW and the like) yeah I know, but I can dream, and I'll listen politely to offers. You can have a different idea of what it's worth. I have mine. And I know you never get back what you put into it. Total the cost of the parts already on it and the ones that go with it. I think the price is fair. But be polite and I'll listen.\n\nBut no, I don't need help selling it and I'm not shipping it to Dubai or wherever. Any questions, I'll try to answer."

montgomery,https://okaloosa.craigslist.org/cto/d/1981-bmw-320i-e21/6483882172.html,"I searched for nearly a year before finding a car that I thought I could restore and drive for the rest of my life and maybe even pass along. But life happens and I need to move on. It has about 180,000 miles, is driven every day to Eglin and back. Never let me down. I bought it three years ago from the second owner. It needed some maintenance, but looked great. So I bought it and changed all the maintenance usuals - hoses, belts, thermostat, oxygen sensor, fuel filter, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotor. Then changed out the radiator, replaced the dashboard lights that were out, changed out the old radio and couple of speakers. Bought a sport steering wheel, got a used turn signal stalk so the brights would work, cleaned the grounds and changed bulbs so the lights would work, changed some gaskets and fuses, in other words got it daily driver ready. And for three years I have driven it.\n\nLast summer I did the whole front end - H&R springs, Sachs shocks and struts, new control arms, tie rods, bushings, calipers, rotors, pads, hoses. Ran out of time to get the back done. It drives much better now. Go kart like. Brand new tires about two months ago and the alignment helped too. I have a huge box with more parts that I have collected - wheel bearings, A/C stuff, shifter stuff, hoses, water pump, and more that goes with it. I think I've gotten it to the point where someone can come in and finish what I've started. I also have the factory service manual, though You Tube videos are the better route IMO.\n\nLet's talk about rust. It's originally a California car, but it does have some - bottom of the doors where I guess a drain hole might have been plugged, in the trunk. To tackle that, I have POR-15, their epoxy and mat fiber, spray of the correct color, and clear. But my thought was first do the mechanicals. It looks good now, but that's on next summer's list if I still have it.\n\nInterior's pretty good for it's age. Seats are great except the driver's has split. I have foam to rebuild the base and was going to get new skins, but you can do that. Dash is cracked like almost every other 80's car. A/C is all there and I have o rings and a receiver dryer. As I said, next summer's list. This was a long term, hold until car for me. Just don't have the time or money to keep it right now. If I win the lottery, that will certainly change.\n\nI would consider trades, (maybe I can talk my wife into something interesting - Miata, Mini Cooper, other old BMW, VW and the like) yeah I know, but I can dream, and I'll listen politely to offers. You can have a different idea of what it's worth. I have mine. And I know you never get back what you put into it. Total the cost of the parts already on it and the ones that go with it. I think the price is fair. But be polite and I'll listen.\n\nBut no, I don't need help selling it and I'm not shipping it to Dubai or wherever. Any questions, I'll try to answer."

This was all done while the car was still in Seattle. As soon as I received the car I replaced the exhaust with an oem one and also replaced the 4.91 differential with a 3.73 LSD. The car has leather comfort seats which look new. The back of the rear seat had the leather replaced at some point. The paint is original and excellent. No dash cracks.

chico,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/zinno-1987-bmw-318i-m40/6468021723.html,"For sale is my grey market 1987 318i Zinnoberrot with 140k original miles. I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."
chico,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/1985-bmw-325e-e30/6485687894.html,"This is a 1985 BMW 325e E30. It has a 2.7 I6 and a 5 speed manual transmission. The car was towed by the city over a year ago and was bought as a project. Prior to having a lien title, it had a clean record and title. The body and interior not bad and the paint is better than most comparable E30s. Odometer does not work and stopped at 147,539, so the actual mileage is unknown. There are 2 important issues with the car that I do not have time to correct. The flange on the back of the transmission is damaged due to the flex disk between it and the drive shaft breaking, therefore the transmission and driveshaft are not connected. I have a new flex disk and the bolts to put it back on. The other issue is how the car runs. It runs but it runs rough, requiring throttle input to stay running. I do not know what has caused this issue and don't have the time to correct it. Throughout the car there are other smaller issues, most of them unimportant. Other small repairs that will need to get done include reattaching the hood and replacing the drivers side rear brake caliper, the bleeder valve is broken but I already have a replacement caliper. The left front hub will need to re re-tapped for the remaining 2 lug nuts and the right front shock needs one more nut to hold it on and fix the alignment. Any other issues I am not aware of. You will need to tow it yourself. Text is preferred.\n\n$1900 OBO\nWill trade for motorcycle or a reasonable condition car.\n\nI currently cannot locate my title, so be aware"

This was all done while the car was still in Seattle. As soon as I received the car I replaced the exhaust with an oem one and also replaced the 4.91 differential with a 3.73 LSD. The car has leather comfort seats which look new. The back of the rear seat had the leather replaced at some point. The paint is original and excellent. No dash cracks.

I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."

The car was towed by the city over a year ago and was bought as a project. Prior to having a lien title, it had a clean record and title. The body and interior not bad and the paint is better than most comparable E30s. Odometer does not work and stopped at 147,539, so the actual mileage is unknown. There are 2 important issues with the car that I do not have time to correct. The flange on the back of the transmission is damaged due to the flex disk between it and the drive shaft breaking, therefore the transmission and driveshaft are not connected. I have a new flex disk and the bolts to put it back on. The other issue is how the car runs. It runs but it runs rough, requiring throttle input to stay running. I do not know what has caused this issue and don't have the time to correct it. Throughout the car there are other smaller issues, most of them unimportant. Other small repairs that will need to get done include reattaching the hood and replacing the drivers side rear brake caliper, the bleeder valve is broken but I already have a replacement caliper. The left front hub will need to re re-tapped for the remaining 2 lug nuts and the right front shock needs one more nut to hold it on and fix the alignment. Any other issues I am not aware of.

Registration fees are all paid through June of 2018, but the previous owner couldn't get it to pass smog, so the tags expired in June of 2017. There are NO back fees currently and all it would need is a smog to register. I'm no expert, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that it'll need an engine for that.\n\nWheels are from a 2001 VW Golf cabrio.

gold_country,https://reno.craigslist.org/cto/d/1987-bmw-318i-m40-german/6469404515.html,"For sale is my grey market 1987 318i Zinnoberrot with 140k original miles. I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."

This was all done while the car was still in Seattle. As soon as I received the car I replaced the exhaust with an oem one and also replaced the 4.91 differential with a 3.73 LSD. The car has leather comfort seats which look new. The back of the rear seat had the leather replaced at some point. The paint is original and excellent. No dash cracks.

The car runs great and cosmetically the interior and exterior are in great condition for its age. It has lots of miles but these cars will last 400k if they are maintained correctly. I used this as my daily driver for the last 7 years but I have another car now and need to simplify things.\n\nAC and heater both work great. I personally maintained the car as long as I have owned it and know it really well.\n\nHere is what I have replaced/repaired recently:\n\nI just changed the oil, filter, plugs, belts and tuned it up within the last few weeks. It has always had regular oil changes, etc.\n\nWithin the last 6 months, I installed a new radiator and a new water pump.\n\nWithin the last year, I replaced the rear end differential and installed a new battery.\n\nWithin the last 1.5 years, I replaced the in-line interior fuel pump, exterior fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel pump relay switch, a number of fuel hoses, the oxygen sensor and brake pads.\n\nAt some point with the last couple of years, the master cylinder was replaced and both rear drums were replaced.\n\nI can't think of anything that needs to be done to the car right now - it is in great shape. Clean title and current registration.\n\nEmail me if interested and we can schedule a time to see it. Asking $3450.\n\nThanks."

Now, 40 years since, she's completely restored and sports a rare German 1980 M90 engine and drivetrain; never driven in the rain.\n\nM90 engine history:\nThe M90 was the first road going BMW engine with 3.5 litre displacement. Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves. The use of an electronically controlled fuel management system (Bosch LE-Jetronic) allowed a slightly higher compression of 9.3:1. Strictly, the M90 engine is not an M production engine although the E12 ///M535I in which it is used is a real M car.

I get compliments all the time. It's a very clean daily.\n\nThe S52 was professionally installed by renowned E30 pros Castro Motorsports. Motor was rebuilt but no paperwork. Castro wouldn't install junk parts though. S52 tranny has around 130k.\n\nCar is a great daily and all around fun car but you swap out to race tires you can have a track ready car too.\n\nFor those who don't know what a S52 is, that is the motor in the 96 to 99 E36 M3 motor. It's rated at 240hp to the flywheel and being in a lighter chassis like the E30, it's really quick and agile.\n\nHighlights...\n\n-CLEAN TITLE! -all panels have original vin including bumpers! -BAR legal. yes the swap is smog legal!!!! -New clutch when s52 was installed with single mass flywheel -Quick as hell! E36 powertrain in a lighter chassis -S52 motor with S50 intake. low miles\n-Z3 1.9L steering rack. linear control and VERY responsive. 2.7 turns lock to lock vs stock 4 turns!!! -2.93 LSD-***WORKING AC, HEAT and even cruise control*** -Working gauge cluster including odometer, speedo , etc... -refurbished front seats with new ""leather"" and shocks -Ronal LS 15 inch wheels w Dunlops 205/55/15 tires.

Could be oil filter gasket, crankcast pressure vent or something else. It's not a major leak but I always do full disclosure -dash cracks but has dash cover -paint is good for age and original. not really a low but it's a not show car. still shines nicely after 30 years. -- Front spoiler and rear trunk spoiler repainted. Everything else original with some 'patina' -brake light on overhead display sometimes turns on but the brake lights do work!-needs new front headliner to hold up OBC controls -- when AC is on idle sometimes ""hunts"" -power antenna is not working -- driver's window works intermittently. I think it's the gears need lubing -- battery tray area has some corrosion. Typical e30 -- some bolt holes in trunk area. Used to have a tow hitch but I took it off to do the bumper tuck -- 1 rear radio speaker not working -- door tweeters not working - clutch chatter from lightened single mass flywheel. Small battery drain. I haven't looked for the issue. It's fine when driven daily. If left sitting for a week the battery will need to be charged.\n\ncan drives and handles great!\n\nNo test drives without cash in hand.\n\nPlease no asking for my number to text me a billion questions.

(Maybe the foreign-delivery plan should be mandatory for this car.) The M5 is, you see, the quickest and fastest regular­ production four-door automobile this magazine has ever tested. it 's the strongest four-door, And sheer power may not even be the M5's best quality. Its true best quality may be just that: its pure best-ness. Given some perfectly reasonable criteria, BMW's new-generation M5 just might be the best car in the world. Take the engine, for starters--a crown jewel of a powerplant. The BMW S38 in­ line six began life as the 24-valve special powering the marvelous but star-crossed 1978 M1 supercar. More than just a twin ­cam-head conversion on the true-blue BMW 3.5, it included a juggling of bore and stroke dimensions, With mechanical fuel injection, Bigger front-brake rotors (0.5 inch larger in diameter, 0.2 inch thicker) balance the M5's speed and mass. Anti-lock control is standard, naturally. Engine-speed-sensitive variable-assist power steering it has been quickened from an overall ratio of 16.2 to 15.6:1.

ventura_county,https://orangecounty.craigslist.org/cto/d/1987-e30-bmw-325is-stroker/6474413011.html,"Hello all, for sale I have a track-spec 1987 BMW 325is, with plenty of parts replaced/modified. The engine is a 2.8 Stroker motor, which just today, had the rocker arms go out. The rocker arms were proved to be a bad batch from Ireland Engineering, as per my reputable mechanic. The buyer has the options of sending the arms back, and refurbishing the head with a new cam and rocker arms, and having an absolute blast of a track car/canyon car, or daily if you wish if you do not mind the absence of A/C, Power-Steering, and a Stereo System. Wires are all there, yet the units have been removed. It's saddening that I am forced to sell this, though my school schedule does not allow me to work on cars much often anymore, or anything extensive. As this was my daily, you can see why I'm forced to part ways. The car steered, handled, braked, and shifted phenomenally. Everything on the car is very solid, and taken care of. With the replacement of the rocker arms, and cam, or even a new, stock 2.5 head, you would have a beast of a car to thrash on with no issues. The interior is near flawless, with all original leather sport seats, and leather rear seats. Everything else on the car has been addressed to it's maximum potential. This car comes with a Clean CA Title, in my name, with tags and smog received and done less than 2 months ago. Smog is still valid. Easily $10,000 and over have been invested in parts into this car, and it's a true shame that a fresh rebuild was subject to this unfortunate mishap. Those who know about these cars and their value, or know how to work on them, will be getting a killer deal. On this particular car, the head swap is relatively straight forward, and due to the shaving of engine bay and absence of engine accessories, it will be easier to replace the head than your standard, stock E30s or BMWs of the era in general. Below is a parts list, of which all parts were replaced with OEM or better:\n\nDrive-train Components:\n\nFully Rebuilt 2.8 Stroker Motor (Less than 3-5,000 miles)\n-Garagistic 95A Polyurethane Engine Mounts\n-Turner Motorsports Chip\n-Fuel Filter\n-Ported & Polished 885 decked head\n-Machined\n-NGK Spark Plugs\n-2.7 Block bored to 2.8\n-Ireland Engineering Heavy Duty Rockers\n-272 Camshaft\n-NUKE Adjustable Cam Gear\n-Over-sized Valves\n-Gates Racing Timing Belt\n-UUC Lightweight Flywheel\n-New complete Cooling System (Radiator, Hoses, Water Pump, Thermostat, Coolant, Fan Clutch, Fan Shroud)\n-Long-Tube Headers with Dual to Single Exhaust\n-Oil Changed with 20w-40 Castrol GTX Oil and Shorter Oil filter to accommodate long-tube this month (January)\n-Valve Adjustment done 2 months ago\n-Air-Conditioning and Power-Steering systems deleted\n-Fuel Relays Relocation\n\nTransmission to Differential\n-Excedy Clutch\n-Garagistic 95A Transmission Mounts\n-Garagistic 95A Differential Mount\n-Fully Rebuilt Transmission\n-Lucas Oil Transmission Fluid\n-UUC Short-Shifter with DSSR\n-Refurbished Driveshaft, replaced Guibo, and Center-Support Bearing\n-3.73 Limited-Slip Differential with Lucas Oil Differential Fluid\n\nSuspension & Steering Performance Enhancing Components:\n-Ireland Engineering Stage 3 Springs with Bilstein Sport Shocks\n-Adjustable UUC 22m Front & 19mm Rear Sway Bars with end-links\n-Garagistic Front Strut Bar\n-New Lemforder Control Arms\n-Garagistic 95A Off-set Control Arm Bushings\n-Garagistic Reinforced Front Subframe\n-Garagistic Reinforced Rear Subframe and adjustable Trailing Arms\n-Garagistic 95A Trailing Arm Bushings\n-Z3 1.9 Steering Rack with Delrin Steering Coupler\n\n\nWheels/Tires/Brakes:\n-15x7 TRM Track Wheels\n-Federal 595 RSR Tires\n-Slotted & Drilled Rotors\n-Ceramic Brake Pads\n-Braided Brake lines\n\n\nExterior Cosmetics and Specs:\n-Straight Late Model Front Valance\n-Un-cracked Late Model Front Plastic Bumper\n-Euro Plastic Bumper Trim\n-Fog-Light Delete Blanks, Brake-Ducts, and Center Duct all purchased new\n-Smoked Turn Signals (Not wired up)\n-Euro Grills\n-Shaved & Painted Engine Bay\n-Early Model Rear Plate Filler\n\n\nInterior Cosmetics and Specs:\n-Jaffster Delrin Shift Knob\n-M-Tech Shift Boot\n-Front and Rear Leather Sport Seats in Great Shape\n-Audio System Deleted\n-Momo Hub with 350mm Momo Wheel\n-NRG Quick-Release\n-Fully Working Automatic Windows and Sunroof\n-Rear Pop-Out Windows"

I take it out on the highway every weekend. Otherwise it sits in my garage on a trickle charger. I'm the 3rd owner. I bought it on ebay and then had the owner, a mechanic, convert from automatic to manual transmission, added S & R sport springs, Bilstein sport shocks, 4 new brake pads, a BMW Z3 1.9 shifter with new bushings, and new tires. This was all done while the car was still in Seattle. As soon as I received the car I replaced the exhaust with an oem one and also replaced the 4.91 differential with a 3.73 LSD. The car has leather comfort seats which look new. The back of the rear seat had the leather replaced at some point. The paint is original and excellent. No dash cracks. The car is in exceptional condition. No rust. Everything works. All fender tags are matching. I am selling it because I recently bought a Toyota MR 2 Turbo and need the garage space.

yuba-sutter,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/zinno-1987-bmw-318i-m40/6468021723.html,"For sale is my grey market 1987 318i Zinnoberrot with 140k original miles. I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."
yuba-sutter,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/1985-bmw-325e-e30/6485687894.html,"This is a 1985 BMW 325e E30. It has a 2.7 I6 and a 5 speed manual transmission. The car was towed by the city over a year ago and was bought as a project. Prior to having a lien title, it had a clean record and title. The body and interior not bad and the paint is better than most comparable E30s. Odometer does not work and stopped at 147,539, so the actual mileage is unknown. There are 2 important issues with the car that I do not have time to correct. The flange on the back of the transmission is damaged due to the flex disk between it and the drive shaft breaking, therefore the transmission and driveshaft are not connected. I have a new flex disk and the bolts to put it back on. The other issue is how the car runs. It runs but it runs rough, requiring throttle input to stay running. I do not know what has caused this issue and don't have the time to correct it. Throughout the car there are other smaller issues, most of them unimportant. Other small repairs that will need to get done include reattaching the hood and replacing the drivers side rear brake caliper, the bleeder valve is broken but I already have a replacement caliper. The left front hub will need to re re-tapped for the remaining 2 lug nuts and the right front shock needs one more nut to hold it on and fix the alignment. Any other issues I am not aware of. You will need to tow it yourself. Text is preferred.\n\n$1900 OBO\nWill trade for motorcycle or a reasonable condition car.\n\nI currently cannot locate my title, so be aware"

I have since replaced the engine due to the original one's timing belt breaking.\n\nI just recently started it after sitting for about a year since I moved out of town for another job. It was making a noise before I left and when I got back I investigated it further and found the crank pulley was working loose and rubbing the back of the water pump pulley. I torqued it back down and all is well again. But I did buy a new timing kit and water pump thinking a loose tensioner was the noise. So thats in the trunk.\n\nThe only problem I am having engine wise now is it idles really rough on a cold start even to the point of stalling out if you don't keep the throttle cracked open. I have replaced both temperature sensors and put a new thermostat in it. I am thinking a cold start injector? Haven't spent the time to finish solving the problem. Once it warms up it's fine. And every subsequent start is fine. I also bought a new Bosch throttle switch thinking that was it, but it's not looking like that's the issue either.\n\nThe clutch slave cylinder started to leak. Last time I drove it I was losing the clutch pedal. I stopped and checked the fluid and found it was low. So I filled the reservoir and bled the clutch out and noticed the fluid was running down the bellhousing. And I haven't drove it since.\n\nIt needs shocks and struts. Bad. I have brand new Lemforder control arms and whiteline polyurethane control arm bushings ready to be installed.\n\nIt also will need a new front gasket for the convertible top. I keep it covered when I know it's going to rain. And it stayed covered the entire time I was away working out of state.\n\nYou can see in the pics that it needs body work on the rear passenger side. Taillight still works aside from the turn signal. That is inoperable.\n\nThe wheels on it are forged aluminum if my research is correct. I think they are vintage VW aftermarket wheels. They have AMIL stamped on the inside. I could be sitting on a goldmine and not even know it. Lol. I doubt it though. They are kinda rough honestly. Someone would need to spend a weekend of two stripping, painting and polishing them to make them anything.\n\nI think I am just ready to move on from it. I have owned the car for about 5 years or so and it's my second E30 I have owned. There's just so much I wanted to do to it and i just dont have the financial backing to take it on. And I don't want it to rot away. I'd like to see it at the next cars and coffee or a BMW meet. Or it might just end up parted out and in bins in someone's garage helping some other poor soul. Looking at you Charles ;)\n\nAnyway text me if you're interested. show contact info"

This is one of the first years the that most famous model BMW made, the E30, was made with a diesel engine. It has the BMW M21 diesel engine (this is not the turbo engine). If you Google best diesel engines and do your research, this will come up as one of the best. We imported the car from Europe and are the third owners. The first was a lady in Germany, and the second was a couple in the Netherlands. For a diesel that is a baby. The car is my daily driver. I only drive 12 miles each way to work.

okaloosa_/_walton,https://okaloosa.craigslist.org/cto/d/1981-bmw-320i-e21/6483882172.html,"I searched for nearly a year before finding a car that I thought I could restore and drive for the rest of my life and maybe even pass along. But life happens and I need to move on. It has about 180,000 miles, is driven every day to Eglin and back. Never let me down. I bought it three years ago from the second owner. It needed some maintenance, but looked great. So I bought it and changed all the maintenance usuals - hoses, belts, thermostat, oxygen sensor, fuel filter, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotor. Then changed out the radiator, replaced the dashboard lights that were out, changed out the old radio and couple of speakers. Bought a sport steering wheel, got a used turn signal stalk so the brights would work, cleaned the grounds and changed bulbs so the lights would work, changed some gaskets and fuses, in other words got it daily driver ready. And for three years I have driven it.\n\nLast summer I did the whole front end - H&R springs, Sachs shocks and struts, new control arms, tie rods, bushings, calipers, rotors, pads, hoses. Ran out of time to get the back done. It drives much better now. Go kart like. Brand new tires about two months ago and the alignment helped too. I have a huge box with more parts that I have collected - wheel bearings, A/C stuff, shifter stuff, hoses, water pump, and more that goes with it. I think I've gotten it to the point where someone can come in and finish what I've started. I also have the factory service manual, though You Tube videos are the better route IMO.\n\nLet's talk about rust. It's originally a California car, but it does have some - bottom of the doors where I guess a drain hole might have been plugged, in the trunk. To tackle that, I have POR-15, their epoxy and mat fiber, spray of the correct color, and clear. But my thought was first do the mechanicals. It looks good now, but that's on next summer's list if I still have it.\n\nInterior's pretty good for it's age. Seats are great except the driver's has split. I have foam to rebuild the base and was going to get new skins, but you can do that. Dash is cracked like almost every other 80's car. A/C is all there and I have o rings and a receiver dryer. As I said, next summer's list. This was a long term, hold until car for me. Just don't have the time or money to keep it right now. If I win the lottery, that will certainly change.\n\nI would consider trades, (maybe I can talk my wife into something interesting - Miata, Mini Cooper, other old BMW, VW and the like) yeah I know, but I can dream, and I'll listen politely to offers. You can have a different idea of what it's worth. I have mine. And I know you never get back what you put into it. Total the cost of the parts already on it and the ones that go with it. I think the price is fair. But be polite and I'll listen.\n\nBut no, I don't need help selling it and I'm not shipping it to Dubai or wherever. Any questions, I'll try to answer."

But life happens and I need to move on. It has about 180,000 miles, is driven every day to Eglin and back. Never let me down. I bought it three years ago from the second owner. It needed some maintenance, but looked great. So I bought it and changed all the maintenance usuals - hoses, belts, thermostat, oxygen sensor, fuel filter, plugs, wires, distributor cap and rotor. Then changed out the radiator, replaced the dashboard lights that were out, changed out the old radio and couple of speakers. Bought a sport steering wheel, got a used turn signal stalk so the brights would work, cleaned the grounds and changed bulbs so the lights would work, changed some gaskets and fuses, in other words got it daily driver ready. And for three years I have driven it.\n\nLast summer I did the whole front end - H&R springs, Sachs shocks and struts, new control arms, tie rods, bushings, calipers, rotors, pads, hoses. Ran out of time to get the back done. It drives much better now. Go kart like. Brand new tires about two months ago and the alignment helped too. I have a huge box with more parts that I have collected - wheel bearings, A/C stuff, shifter stuff, hoses, water pump, and more that goes with it. I think I've gotten it to the point where someone can come in and finish what I've started. I also have the factory service manual, though You Tube videos are the better route IMO.\n\nLet's talk about rust. It's originally a California car, but it does have some - bottom of the doors where I guess a drain hole might have been plugged, in the trunk. To tackle that, I have POR-15, their epoxy and mat fiber, spray of the correct color, and clear. But my thought was first do the mechanicals. It looks good now, but that's on next summer's list if I still have it.\n\nInterior's pretty good for it's age. Seats are great except the driver's has split. I have foam to rebuild the base and was going to get new skins, but you can do that. Dash is cracked like almost every other 80's car. A/C is all there and I have o rings and a receiver dryer.

The sunroof works and seals properly, all windows roll up and down with ease. This car does not have AC but it is mechanically good enough for a daily driver and AC can be added fairly cheap (they sell ready to go kits online). Also, the color is a little lighter than shown in the pics. The sunset was bright orange that day making it a little stronger color than it actually is. Looks really awesome in person! This car has the front bumper delete with the upgraded front spoiler from the turbo that gives it an awesome aggressive look.\n\nThe engine runs REALLY smooth, gears shift extremely easy and smooth as well. The car has fresh rebuild, new clutch, new battery, new spark plugs and upgraded Weber Carb. I do have a jet kit for the carb that I will include with the sale in the case you want to tune it differently than I have it.\n\nThe interior is in great shape also. The dash does have some cracks that aren't too noticeable (I'll include a dash carpet with purchase).

Now, 40 years since, she's completely restored and sports a rare German 1980 M90 engine and drivetrain; never driven in the rain.\n\nM90 engine history:\nThe M90 was the first road going BMW engine with 3.5 litre displacement. Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves. The use of an electronically controlled fuel management system (Bosch LE-Jetronic) allowed a slightly higher compression of 9.3:1. Strictly, the M90 engine is not an M production engine although the E12 ///M535I in which it is used is a real M car. Until 1981, the M90 engine was used for the early 635CSI and the very rare and delectable E12 ///M535I from 1980.\n(The Beginning of a Legacy - A BMW Motor Evolution By tschultz | 5 November, 2014)\n\nFeatures:\nEUROPEAN\nCalifornia Classic Appraisal $22.4K\nM90 drivetrain / dogleg 5 speed transmission\n80K original engine miles / 60K original vehicle miles (odometer reads 96K kilometers)\nTopasbraun (Topaz brown) metallic paint / Palomino interior\nRare 17"" Rondell Type 21 wheels\nFull tread Good Year Eagle F1 215/40ZR17 (front), Uniroyal 255/40ZR17 (rear) sticky rubbers\nRECARO Kirchheim seats\nBilstein shocks/struts\nSunroof\nOil cooler\nRaid steering wheel (Italian)\nKenwood stereo\nExceptional condition\n\n$17.5K\n\nThanks for your interest\n\nRem\n\nshow contact info mob\nshow contact info"

It has an oil leak at the bottom of the oil return line from the turbo. Also head gasket is starting to go.\n\nI've owned this car for 2 years now and have never had an issue with it. It is originally from Idaho and I bought it from the first owner in DC. I have ALL the original documentation from when it was first purchased as well as all the services that have been done to this e30. I have a whole binder filled with original documents. Odometer still running.\n\nIn may of 2017 my friend and I put a turbocharger on the m20b27. We used a MSPNP2 as our ECU and replaced it with the original ECU for the 325e. The old ECU is still in the car in its original position.\nI did the turbo build with my friend and have all the records and documentation as well as pictures of us completing it. I have a little booklet of everything that we did. This includes:\nMSPNP 2 ecu\nT3 Turbocharger\nTurbo manifold\nRally Sport Direct downpipe\nmishimoto intercooler and piping\nMVS TiAL wastegate\nAll gaskets are new\nThe timing belt and water pump were completed recently at century BMW in Greenville SC. At that time the coolant was flushed as well.\n\nI also have a quick release set up with a wooden steering wheel\nWheels are 15x8 Enkei 92s\nRacing Dynamics front bumper\n\nThis e30 does have a cracked dash and is missing the kick panel\nCurrently the tachometer does not work. I have put on about 1500 miles since it stopped working.\nHere's the big thing. There seems to be a small boost leak. I have removed the turbo manifold several times and have not found a crack in it. However, the couplers and ring clamps that hold the intercooler piping together are from eBay and I have not had the time to go over all my couplers to replace the ring clamps with heavy duty clamps.\nNevertheless I have the e30 set to 8 psi at the moment and can still get some boost with a little delay.\nAnother issue at the moment is the internal fuel pump. It is VERY easy to replace I just don't have the $100 right now to order the part. My Idle control valve could be dirty and causes the car at first start up of the day to rev high until the car warms up. It does this for about 1-2 minutes\nI deleted the AC took out the compressor and lightened the vehicle by about 45lbs\n\n\n\nThis car is very reliable. I still have my VA tags on it because I just moved from Virginia. I drove it down here 1,100 miles and have been dayling it to work every day putting on about 40 miles a day. This car is very reliable and it has never broken down on me.\nOccasionally my temperature gauge will give out but that's no problem. Thanks to the MSPNP 2 ECU I can connect my laptop to the e30 and it will tell me exactly at what temperature the e30 is running at.\n\n\n\nRecently I changed the valve cover gasket\nChanged the oil and filter\nExternal fuel pump\nDid a coolant flush and changed the hoses that needed to be changed. There are about 200-300 miles on the vehicle with the new coolant.\nI painted the vehicle with original BMW code 139 bronzit beige about 1200 miles ago.\n\n\nWhat this car needs:\nUnfortunately recently I had a small fender bender. I was making a left, lost control because the vehicle started to hydroplane and hit the side of a parked vehicle. The only damage done to the car is the front bumper, the front right blinker light, the driver's side quarter panel and the hood.\nI have seen multiple people parting out their e30s and switching the panel and getting a new hood is no problem. After getting these parts the e30 will be as good as it was before the accident. I am missing the bumper surrounds but I have seen those available as well.\n\nI am asking 5k or best offer. I am looking to trade for another e30 or a motorcycle. In parts alone this car has a lot of money in it. There are roughly 156k on the engine and about 3k since the turbo was installed. Hit me up with your offer.\n\n\nkawasaki bmw e30 e28 yamaha honda cbr r6 r1 636 zx6r zx7r motorcycle"

This is one of the first years the that most famous model BMW made, the E30, was made with a diesel engine. It has the BMW M21 diesel engine (this is not the turbo engine). If you Google best diesel engines and do your research, this will come up as one of the best. We imported the car from Europe and are the third owners. The first was a lady in Germany, and the second was a couple in the Netherlands. For a diesel that is a baby. The car is my daily driver. I only drive 12 miles each way to work. The car starts perfectly and there is never a concern with any problems. It gets about 33 or 34 miles per gallon. The only reason we are selling it is because we are moving to a place with a dirt road. I have a clear Georgia title in hand!\n\nThe Good: The mileage is in kilos and from my gas logs they are approximate. The car has 167,882 kilos (approximately 105,00 miles!!). Remember 0.62 miles = 1 kilo.\n\n03/2015: New front rotors, back rotors turned, new front and back brake pads, transmission fluid changes, new fuel filter, and new brake fluid. Mileage was 158712 kilos.\n\n04/2016: New lifetime Mishimoto radiator, new fan, new fan clutch, new belts, new glow plugs, new glow plug fuse, new water pump, new mats, and new K & N lifetime air filter. The thermostat was changed in 04/16 also. The original thermostat for the car runs at the 3/4 spot (remember it is cold in Europe so the car runs hotter) so it was changed to the 524td (American) thermostat which has the needle at half.Mileage was 161272 kilos.\n\n06/16: New Garagistic shift bushings. Mileage was 162621 kilos.\n\n09/16: Style 10 rims professionally refinished and new tires. Mileage was 163530 kilos.\n\nThe Bad -The car is over 30 years old and has some minor issues with some small spots on the body that need to be treated. I think the clear coat may have worn as it is hard to get stains from leaves off. Nothing major. I had planned to take it to Maaco to refresh it, take care of the small spots, and get a new clear coat but never got to it. -This a Euro car. It does not have air conditioning.\n-When the car is cold the brake light comes on. When it warms up the light goes off. Research shows that this is a common problem and has to do with the solder on the connection. I have never had the time to do this project. But there is a youtube video that walks you through this if that is a problem for you.\n-The lower seat heater and the power antennae do not work. I had replaced the antennae when i first got the car but those things don't hold up for long.\n-Parts can be challenging to get but I have a c.d. that dealers use. You put in the VIN and it gives you the part numbers. This helps find parts easier. Some parts are available in the U.S. because of the Amercian available 524TD. It used the same engine. But others have to be found on Ebay or searching the internet and most of the time come from England or Germany.\n\nPlease email any questions. No Shipping is available. You must make arrangements to pick the vehicle up in Saint Marys, Georgia. The listed price is my lowest acceptable price. Thanks for looking."

st_augustine,https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/cto/d/1987-bmw-325i-convertible/6472467074.html,"Unknown mileage the odometer stopped at 177k. I have since replaced the engine due to the original one's timing belt breaking.\n\nI just recently started it after sitting for about a year since I moved out of town for another job. It was making a noise before I left and when I got back I investigated it further and found the crank pulley was working loose and rubbing the back of the water pump pulley. I torqued it back down and all is well again. But I did buy a new timing kit and water pump thinking a loose tensioner was the noise. So thats in the trunk.\n\nThe only problem I am having engine wise now is it idles really rough on a cold start even to the point of stalling out if you don't keep the throttle cracked open. I have replaced both temperature sensors and put a new thermostat in it. I am thinking a cold start injector? Haven't spent the time to finish solving the problem. Once it warms up it's fine. And every subsequent start is fine. I also bought a new Bosch throttle switch thinking that was it, but it's not looking like that's the issue either.\n\nThe clutch slave cylinder started to leak. Last time I drove it I was losing the clutch pedal. I stopped and checked the fluid and found it was low. So I filled the reservoir and bled the clutch out and noticed the fluid was running down the bellhousing. And I haven't drove it since.\n\nIt needs shocks and struts. Bad. I have brand new Lemforder control arms and whiteline polyurethane control arm bushings ready to be installed.\n\nIt also will need a new front gasket for the convertible top. I keep it covered when I know it's going to rain. And it stayed covered the entire time I was away working out of state.\n\nYou can see in the pics that it needs body work on the rear passenger side. Taillight still works aside from the turn signal. That is inoperable.\n\nThe wheels on it are forged aluminum if my research is correct. I think they are vintage VW aftermarket wheels. They have AMIL stamped on the inside. I could be sitting on a goldmine and not even know it. Lol. I doubt it though. They are kinda rough honestly. Someone would need to spend a weekend of two stripping, painting and polishing them to make them anything.\n\nI think I am just ready to move on from it. I have owned the car for about 5 years or so and it's my second E30 I have owned. There's just so much I wanted to do to it and i just dont have the financial backing to take it on. And I don't want it to rot away. I'd like to see it at the next cars and coffee or a BMW meet. Or it might just end up parted out and in bins in someone's garage helping some other poor soul. Looking at you Charles ;)\n\nAnyway text me if you're interested. show contact info"

It had 670k miles on the original engine, original transmission...the engine was replaced with a rebuilt 2.5 liter in 2005. The transmission was rebuilt at the same time. In 2000 I replaced the entire fuel injection system, fuel lines, gas tank and exhaust. The car is not running now, the original alternator needs to be replaced. Mechanically it won't need much work. The electrical wiring/ac will need attention. It has manual windows and sunroof. All glass is original and in great shape. Basically everything on the car is original except for the engine. Clear title.\nThe past 18 months, the car has been sitting. Outside. I live 300 feet from the beach. Body rust. I know, not cool.\nI don't have to tell you the attachment and memories I have with the car. It was loved, garage kept, properly serviced and pampered for 30 years. With much regret, resurrecting it from its current state is a project that I will not be able to perform. I want it to go to an owner that will bring it back to life.

valdosta,https://jacksonville.craigslist.org/cto/d/1987-bmw-325i-convertible/6472467074.html,"Unknown mileage the odometer stopped at 177k. I have since replaced the engine due to the original one's timing belt breaking.\n\nI just recently started it after sitting for about a year since I moved out of town for another job. It was making a noise before I left and when I got back I investigated it further and found the crank pulley was working loose and rubbing the back of the water pump pulley. I torqued it back down and all is well again. But I did buy a new timing kit and water pump thinking a loose tensioner was the noise. So thats in the trunk.\n\nThe only problem I am having engine wise now is it idles really rough on a cold start even to the point of stalling out if you don't keep the throttle cracked open. I have replaced both temperature sensors and put a new thermostat in it. I am thinking a cold start injector? Haven't spent the time to finish solving the problem. Once it warms up it's fine. And every subsequent start is fine. I also bought a new Bosch throttle switch thinking that was it, but it's not looking like that's the issue either.\n\nThe clutch slave cylinder started to leak. Last time I drove it I was losing the clutch pedal. I stopped and checked the fluid and found it was low. So I filled the reservoir and bled the clutch out and noticed the fluid was running down the bellhousing. And I haven't drove it since.\n\nIt needs shocks and struts. Bad. I have brand new Lemforder control arms and whiteline polyurethane control arm bushings ready to be installed.\n\nIt also will need a new front gasket for the convertible top. I keep it covered when I know it's going to rain. And it stayed covered the entire time I was away working out of state.\n\nYou can see in the pics that it needs body work on the rear passenger side. Taillight still works aside from the turn signal. That is inoperable.\n\nThe wheels on it are forged aluminum if my research is correct. I think they are vintage VW aftermarket wheels. They have AMIL stamped on the inside. I could be sitting on a goldmine and not even know it. Lol. I doubt it though. They are kinda rough honestly. Someone would need to spend a weekend of two stripping, painting and polishing them to make them anything.\n\nI think I am just ready to move on from it. I have owned the car for about 5 years or so and it's my second E30 I have owned. There's just so much I wanted to do to it and i just dont have the financial backing to take it on. And I don't want it to rot away. I'd like to see it at the next cars and coffee or a BMW meet. Or it might just end up parted out and in bins in someone's garage helping some other poor soul.

muncie_/_anderson,https://dayton.craigslist.org/cto/d/es-e30-bmw/6483635849.html,"PLEASE READ ALL BEFORE CONTACTING ME. THANK YOU!\nI regretfully think it's time to part ways with my E30. I have owned it for 5 years, and have replaced nearly every wear component, and have receipts for nearly $6,000 in parts only. It is red with a tan leather interior. It's been a great car experience, and I really enjoy it, but I cannot give it the attention I should. I have literally driven it 200 miles in 6 months. Not to mention, I bought a Z4 convertible, and I like open-air driving. I'm about to graduate college this May, and I simply don't need three vehicles (especially 3 BMWs!).\nThis car had it all when it came out. Some of it still works, some of it doesn't; however, it still drives well, with a timing belt that is less than a year old. I have been rigorous in the BMW recommended maintenance schedule. All top-of-the-line fluids, filters, parts. You'll simply be hard pressed to find one of these Original E30s anymore. They are rarer by the day. This E30 has the Sport package, which comes with Recarro-type sport seats, a manual transmission. The CARFAX says I'm the second owner. Serious inquiries only. I Will not take ½ of what I've listed it for... I'll consider a best offer, but as a said. These are hard to find.\nPros:\nIt's an E30!\nThe body is in reasonably good condition for a 32 year old car (was resprayed 3 years ago). Some rust on the rocker seams, but nothing major.\nLeather interior\nSport Package with LSD and M sport suspension\nUp-to-date maintenance\nRuns well, shifts nicely\nHeat works\nCons:\nElectronics are finnicky (Window is slow, power locks don't work, and the some speakers come in and out)\nPower steering pump is weak\nA/C is weak, Has been converted to r134a, and compressor rebuilt, but it doesn't work too well. Fan is squeaky\nCracked dash, cracked leather.\nOdometer gears are broken. All other gauges are reliable"

maine,https://maine.craigslist.org/cto/d/1990-bmw-e30-325i-borbet-type/6472388456.html,"Sad day for me but I think I need to let my car go. This car has served me extremely well, and it is the most fun thing to drive in the world. However, I am looking for something different right now and I can't have two cars right now.\n\nThis E30 has been made to be fun and exciting, the reason anyone would want an E30.\n\nFirst I will start with the modifications:\n\n- Aftermarket Exhaust\n- Mishumoto Radiator\n- Short Shifter with aftermarket knob and shaft (will include original wooden knob)\n- BC Racing Coilovers (They're on the hardest setting right now, so let me know if you would like me to tune them to feel softer)\n- Aftermarket Kenwood Stereo (It's a little outdated but it still works perfectly)\n\nHere is the common work I needed done to the car:\n\n- I just replaced the starter with a Bosch one about 50 miles ago. It was just done because the old starter wasn't making the car start first try and wasn't cranking well.\n- Replaced the driver side door latch mechanism since it wasn't staying shut. I did this about 1,200 miles ago.\n- Had my brake lines replaced. They were corroding and were going to burst at any point. A Brake Line dash light lit up after doing this, but I just believe that something electrical had a screw up during the replacement. (It was done professionally) I did this about 1,400 miles ago.\n\nWork still needed:\n\n- This car has everything to pass inspection except for lights. This car's low beams work perfect, but the right low beam bracket broke and the light is being held with electrical tape. The Right High beam is also not working and I took the bulb out. If you can find the matching right lights it will be cheaper, but I would replace the whole system. That will cost anywhere between $200-$600 depending on what you get.\n- There is rust forming on the bottom of the front fenders. One got fixed up professionally (not the prettiest job) on the passenger side, and one is still untreated, but it is still at the beginning stages and is not bad. There are also rust spots on the sun roof and a tiny bit on the hood. These spots are extremely minor, however.\n- The only dents on the car are in the hood. One larger mellow one and one a little larger than a ping pong ball and is a bigger bump.\n- Paint is beautiful but needs TLC in some spots.\n- The seats are original but are in pretty bad shape. Rips and the reclining doesn't work well and is uneven. I've lived with it and they work but they could need a replacement. I was going to get Red Recaro Bucket seats but never got around to do it.\n\nCar has an LSD in it, but I am unsure of the ratio.\n\nThe Borbet's have paint chipping but are still beautiful. They are the old school style 15x7 4x100. They come with tires. The bottlecaps are on the car right now since it is winter and they have snow tires.\n\nEverything about this car is awesome. It's my baby and I want it to go to someone who will care for it and love it as much as I do. I may address the lights issue before selling the car, and I may have an inspection sticker too. I'm asking $4400 with the Borbet Type A's AND Snow Tire Bottlecaps. My price is negotiable, so send me offers!\n\nThe car comes with a binder with the carfax and all of the work ever done to it.\n\nInterested in trades for e39's, e46's, and e90/e92's (I'll throw in cash too depending on the offer)\n\nBest way to ask any more questions is to reach me by text. Email I will respond slower, and I may not always be available to speak over the phone. Thank you, Matt.\n\n\nIgnore:\nbmw e21, e36, e34, e39, e46, 318i, 325is, 328i, 330i, 330ci, 540i, m3, m5, m20, m50, 4x100, borbet"

Classic lines and it looks great on the streets, as well as a pleasure to drive.\n\nThe car has been in upstate NY as well as MA. Unsure of its full background but it seems to have stayed in New England for most of its life. A lot of work has been done - it was not running when purchased. Work included structural welding, rust repair, brakes, and engine. Minimal rust on the paint, however, the rocker panels and underside are weathered, aside from the newly replaced floorpans. Interior is in good shape with only a small rip in the driver's seat. Missing a few parts including a proper center console (I have the ash-tray and hazard button), and some smaller pieces on the doors such as window crank knobs. Up until last year, it started and ran reliably. The car has sat for a little over a year in my driveway, and most likely needs a battery charge to start back up - I just haven't had the time/money to put into it.

The previous owner did a lot of work in restoring the car and modernizing the suspension. Most of the work was done by Ken Blasko of BMW Vintage Racing in Long Beach California. He's a small shop who races 2002s and he does fantastic work.\n\nThe previous owner put in all new suspension with Bilstein HDs and HR Sport springs, new front brakes (stock) and revamped the rears. The engine has been rebuilt from the top up with a surfaced and smoothed 121 head, new Weber 38/38, custom 292 cam, Pertronix electronic ignition, new valve springs and rockers, and new gaskets. All of that work has been done by Ken.\n\nIn October 2016 it was dynoed and it put down 109 HP and 120 lbs/ft torque to the wheels, which puts it at tii levels.\n\nThe second owner did a pretty great job at hacking it and ugly-fying it, which we haven't done much to address. It was originally Sahara Tan, but the original owner had it painted Agave Green, and then the second owner put the current Chamonix White coat over it. It's a decent 10-foot job with ok shine, but it definitely isn't show car pretty.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there isn't much rust. The spare wheel well was starting to rust through a bit, so I sanded down everything and coated it in Por15. There's slight bubbling on the passenger door sill as well, but that's all I've found.\n\nThe second owner redid the interior with E21 Recaros in grey tweed and black vinyl. I think it actually looks pretty cool, but it isn't original. The carpet was pretty grungy, so I tore it out and stripped the interior down to the metal. There was a small portion of floorboard rust in the driver's footwell which I had cut out and repaired by a shop. I sanded down a few small surface rust areas and then coated the entire interior with Por15 before installing all new sound deadening from RAAMaudio and a carpet from Esty. It's all wired up for sound, and I have the pieces for the center console, but I haven't gotten around to having a front panel made yet.\nThe second owner installed an E21 radiator and an E21 5-speed manual (I believe it's a 245), which the third owner improved by adding a shift assembly out of a Z3 - that work was done by Coast Motor Werks in Irvine.\n\nNow for the bad (every vintage car has some bad, right?)...\nThe biggest current need is a new set of piston rings. The exhaust will blow smoke out if you decelerate on throttle at 4000+ RPM. After having the engine gone through by Ken and having the entire top end rebuilt, we've narrowed the problem down to the piston rings. Ken has assured me that it's not something to worry about, but it should be addressed sometime in the future.\n\nThe next thing I would address is the thermostat. Under most conditions, the engine runs along just fine, but after flogging it up and down a canyon or stop and go traffic on an 85deg+ day, the car gets a bit warmer than I'd like. I haven't been able to get the engine temperature into the red, but it gets pretty hot under those circumstances. I've had the radiator leak and pressure tested, and the thermostat replaced. I think it's time to get an aluminum radiator and electric fan to keep the temp down.\n\nOther than that, the second owner saw fit to outfit the car with a few... questionable styling decisions (misfitting spoiler, blacked-out grills, American flag sticker on the back), but nothing too crazy.\n\nTires are all brand new Toyo T1Rs (less than 2000 miles on them) and fluids have always been changed at the appropriate times.\n\nFeel free to text or email with any questions."

The car has about 190k on the chassis but over the winter of 2015 (about 30k ago) I had the head built at a local shop and a bottom end refresh. The car has a schrick 284, HD rocker arms, and upgraded valve spings. Its a beautiful example of an e30 and I haven't seen a cleaner example in such original condition. The car is 99% rust free, has a crack free dash, original bronzit beige paint (which is in good condition but has its imperfections) , and a black sport interior (condition 9/10).\n\nAbout the car:\n190k on chassis 30k on head rebuild (Timing belt and water pump done at the same time)\nSitting on 16x8 e38 style 5s with e30sport 5 lug adapters\nHR Race and Bilstein sports\nCondor Speed Shop solid motor/trans mounts\nFront suspension refresh last winter (tie rods, control arms, strut mounts, front/rear end links.

bemidji,https://minneapolis.craigslist.org/hnp/cto/d/bmw-e30-fully-prepped-iira/6469866797.html,"Hello all,\nI'm selling an E30, which has been fully prepped to be an ice racing car. It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day.

It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day. Again, this is an ice racing car.\n\nPlease email me with any questions!\nThank you."

It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI.

st_cloud,https://minneapolis.craigslist.org/hnp/cto/d/bmw-e30-fully-prepped-iira/6469866797.html,"Hello all,\nI'm selling an E30, which has been fully prepped to be an ice racing car. It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day. Again, this is an ice racing car.\n\nPlease email me with any questions!\nThank you."

The M54B30 that took the m42's place originally had 90,000 miles. The swap was done by Logan Wheeler at ""BimmerShop"" in Harrahan, Louisiana. If you would like another creditable source of information besides myself he's the one to contact. Around 1500 miles have been added since the completion of the build. The only reason of sale is that I need to get my financials in line. If this wasn't the case the car would never be for sale. I'm here to make a honest sale and to be as transparent as possible regarding the car. The work, labor, and parts alone exceed my asking price an the car alone.\n\nThis car is an absolute beast an very reliable. Cranks up an idles every-time as it should. It has not once given me any problems while driving it. I did everything maintenance wise a M54B30 would need therefore leaving you to only need basic maintenance an up keep when necessary. I have no doubt in my mind that the person who buys the car will be 100% happy with it. The car does needs a bit more work as any car would but nothing impairing it from running an driving as it should. There is some minor rust nothing structural but in the usual area on these cars ""Trunk Battery Tray"" other than that the car has a clean body an frame.

Smaller and lighter than the Neue Klasse sedans they were derived from, the 02 set the stage for the stalwart BMW 3 Series. It was the lens through which a generation of Americans discovered BMW and passed down that enthusiasm to their children. The best of the 02 Series was the 2002, powered by the 2-liter version of the 4-cylinder M10 engine, and the best of the 2002s was the ""tii""--Touring Injected International. The 2002tii was a pure driver's car with everything that you needed and nothing that you didn't. At its release in 1972, Car and Driver called it ""...the essence of motoring truth: no strobe stripes, no phony teardrop racing mirrors, no triple turret taillights. Just finely honed machinery in the simplest steel and glass case."" Some forty years later, those words have only become more relevant as BMW has shifted from a driver's brand to a technology brand. The 2002tii improved upon the regular 2002 with upgraded suspension, brakes, and different gearing, but at its heart was a hot 130-horsepower fuel injected version of the M10 engine. That ""finely honed machinery"" produced plenty of buttery torque down low, but screamed above 4000 rpms in a way few cars could match. It was capable of 55 mph in second gear (indicated by the max speeds per gear ticks on the speedometer) and a top speed of 115 mph--all in a simple, comfortable, innocuous two-door sedan that you could drive you mother to church in.\n\nSummary\n\nThis 1972 Verona Red 2002tii has proven that it is indeed capable of that 115 mph top speed despite its only having four gears, which was dutifully noted by Colorado's finest when the current owner conducted his own field test. After a stern warning (and likely reprieve from the end-of-shift paperwork that such an infraction requires) the officer stated that if he had a Verona Red 2002tii, he would likely be tempted to do his own research. That's because the 2002tii brings out the inner hooligan in everyone who sits behind the wheel--you just can't help it!\n\nThis example was confirmed by BMW Classic to have been manufactured on February 1st, 1972 and imported to the US through Hoffman Motors on February 11. From there Classic BMW in Richardson, Texas sold it to its first owner. The trail of its history picks up again in 1984, still in Texas, with the third owner who purchased it from a grad student. He used it for three to four years before parking it in his garage for the next twenty-five years due to a back injury. In 2008 he sold it to Select Classics of Dallas, TX as part of a bundle with a Sunbeam Tiger, who then sold it to the previous owner. That owner was a 2002tii collector who set about restoring it with no less than $60,000 of receipts (all included in a 2.5-inch binder included with the sale). The work included a complete body respray in the original Verona Red, interior items such as a headliner, dashboard, carpet kit, and a virtually complete mechanical restoration.\n\nThe current owner purchased it in 2014 and took the restoration to the next level. He finished it by replacing lots of trim bits and rubber seals, suspension rubber, an operable period-correct Blaupunkt radio, restoring the clock with solid-state internals, and rebuilding the shifter assembly. The factory air conditioning and air conditioning center console were removed and replaced with non-air conditioning parts (all original parts are included). He then sourced a set of 13"" alloy wheels from BMW Heritage, but the stock ""steelies"" and hubcaps are included and in excellent shape. Despite being rebuilt by the previous owner, the original motor had excessive timing chain rattle due to the head being decked too far. Old-school BMW specialist Mark Hutto replaced it with another 1972 tii motor from a car that was just 303 VIN digits later than his car. The replacement motor had 10,000 miles since being rebuilt. This motor includes performance upgrades in the form of a Top End Performance 284 camshaft and head featuring upgraded components. The original numbers-matching motor is included with the sale, along with all other significant original parts.\n\nBoth the previous owners and current owner have done considerable research to trace the mileage and the consensus is that it is original. I verified this in my due-diligence in accepting the car as a consignment. A history of email conversations, along with all records receipts, is included with the car and are organized chronologically in a 3-ring binder. As a result of this stewardship this is one of the best 2002tii's on the market. It is a turn-key car, ready to be driven across the country.\n\nExterior\n\nThe Verona paint is exceptionally presentable. It is an older repaint, but it looks original (in a good way). The masking lines are very well blended in the door jams and require significant searching to find under the hood. A paint gauge report is posted in the pictures. Overall the paint condition is very good. Even close examination reveals only minor imperfections. There are very light swirl marks and just a few minor chips and pits on the lower front spoiler. All trim is intact and in good condition. It is original, but matches the overall patina of the car well. The headlight, indicator, and brake light lenses are in good condition and crack-free with minimal UV fade. The windshield glass has no cracks, and the side window and rear glass are in good shape. The windshield wiper arms and inserts are in excellent condition; the speed fairing on the driver's side wiper is present. The alloy wheels are perfect. They have no bends or curb rash and the center caps are present with crystal clear Roundel emblems. Fresh Avon radial tires are mounted with lots of tread remaining. The steel wheels and hubcaps are also in excellent shape with good rubber.\n\nInterior\n\nThe interior is in excellent shape. Open the door and you greeted by the perfect 2002 smell--classic vinyl with a hint of gasoline. The dashboard, center console, door cards, headliner, and carpet kits have been replaced; the seats are original. There are no odors--other than that wonderful 2002 smell--and it has never been smoked in. The carpet has no stains or tears. It is covered by Coco floor mats. The front seats are in very good shape. The only imperfection is one tear in the driver's seat bottom cushion. The fore / aft, forward folding and recline functions all work correctly. The only imperfection on the rear seat is a scuff on the lower center backrest. The door cards are in excellent shape, with no scuffs, delamination, or missing trim bits. The ""scissor"" door handles are quintessentially classic BMW. The window regulators work smoothly and quietly. The dashboard is free of cracks and has no UV fade. The 3-spoke Turbo steering wheel leather is in very good shape with no glaring wear or failed stitching. The original tii steering wheel is included with the sale and is also in good shape. All instruments work including the clock, which has been rebuilt with solid-state internals. The odometer just crossed 72,000 miles as I write this. The air conditioning center console has been replaced with a non-air conditioning console including the correct BMW Blaupunkt AM / FM stereo. It works perfectly. The heat blows warm and all controls function correctly. The blower motor is quiet. The headliner looks fantastic, but it is sagging (evenly). I'm 6'2"" and my head barely touches with the seat back unreclined. The trunk flooring panels are present, as are the spare tire and jack underneath. A factory owner's manual, service booklets, and two sets of keys are included with the car.\n\nMechanical\n\nThe records and invoices dating to 2008 show extensive mechanical restoration and are included with the sale. Since living in Colorado it has always been attended to by the expert hands of BMW specialist Mark Hutto. Mark did the motor swap, air conditioning delete, and lots of other odds and ends in addition to regular services. Brad Penn 20W-50 oil has always been used with regular oil change intervals. Several extra quarts are included with the sale, along with Mann filters. In addition to the original engine, air conditioning parts, many spares are also included with the sale. The lot fills two large 55-gallon tubs in addition to the original wheels and tires.\n\nThe M10 fires on command on cold or hot starts. It idles smoothly and pulls very strongly to redline. The transmission shifts perfectly smooth and the shifter bushings are crisp and tight. The clutch take-up is correct. The suspension is firm and compliant, and the brakes are strong, with lots of pad thickness and rotor run-out remaining. There are no driveline or wheel bearing noises or vibrations. It passes emissions in Colorado. The current owner encouraged me to spend some time behind the wheel in order to properly assess the car, and it is by far the nicest 2002 I have ever driven. It feels and drives very much like it did when Max Hoffman imported it in 1972.\n\nGlen Shelly is a low volume auto brokerage focused only on the highest quality vehicles.

Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves. The use of an electronically controlled fuel management system (Bosch LE-Jetronic) allowed a slightly higher compression of 9.3:1.

las_vegas,https://lasvegas.craigslist.org/cto/d/1977-bmw-535i-e12-euro/6447197734.html,"Born in Germany as a 1977 BMW 528i. Now, 40 years since, she is completely restored and sports a rare German 1980 M90 engine and drivetrain; never driven in the rain.\n\nM90 engine history:\nThe M90 was the first road going BMW engine with 3.5 litre displacement. Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves. The use of an electronically controlled fuel management system (Bosch LE-Jetronic) allowed a slightly higher compression of 9.3:1. Strictly, the M90 engine is not an M production engine although the E12 ///M535I in which it is used is a real M car. Until 1981, the M90 engine was used for the early 635CSI and the very rare and delectable E12 ///M535I from 1980.\n(The Beginning of a Legacy - A BMW Motor Evolution By tschultz | 5 November, 2014)\n\nFeatures:\nEUROPEAN\nCalifornia Classic Appraisal $22.4K\nM90 drivetrain / dogleg 5 speed transmission\n80K original engine miles / 60K original vehicle miles (odometer reads 96K kilometers)\nTopasbraun (Topaz brown) metallic paint / Palomino interior\nRare 17"" Rondell Type 21 wheels\nFull tread Good Year Eagle F1 215/40ZR17 (front), Uniroyal 255/40ZR17 (rear) sticky rubbers\nBilstein shocks/struts\nOil cooler\nRECARO Kirchheim seats\nSunroof\nRaid steering wheel (Made in Italy)\nKenwood stereo\nExceptional condition\n\n$17.5K firm; loan payoff\n\nThanks for your interest\n\nRaio\n\nshow contact info mob\nshow contact info"

I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."

reno_/_tahoe,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/zinno-1987-bmw-318i-m40/6468021723.html,"For sale is my grey market 1987 318i Zinnoberrot with 140k original miles. I recently was in a car accident in which totaled my 07 cooper s daily. My plan was to get this car as perfect as possible and either hang on to it or pass it on to a collector.\n\nI purchased this car because it is an out of the ordinary car that is unlike any other e30 I've driven. This m40 powered 318i was imported from Germany in 1999 and driven until traded in at the local BMW dealership last year with a bad transmission. One of the technicians purchased it and replaced with a transmission from a m42 318i along with the drive shaft and used it as a daily driver. Once I got the car the interior was shredded, paint was faded, had a faulty fuel injector and the car ran a little hot (up to the third tick on the temp gauge). All of which has been sorted. This car has been a fun project. It's easy to get parts and has been really easy to work on.\n\nI think this car is kind of special because it is a very bare bones e30. It is an m40 powered car which was not available in the united states. Surprisingly it is easy to drive, cruises 80 mph all day with more than enough power to get out of its own way. It also has manual crank windows all around, manual sunroof, no check panel, euro clock, factory manual steering, no factory ac (not even plumbed for ac), rear drum brakes, solid front rotors (just converted to vented discs and 325i calipers). It is the first late model e30 year available (1987 - plastic bumpers were not available here until 1989). Overall it is fun to drive, gets plenty of complements and there is never an e30 like it anywhere you go.\n\nThe exterior condition is 8/10, the paint was resprayed and there are small imperfections and the valance is flaking some paint. no dents. There are a few scuffs on the bumper trim. NO RUST! Interior is 8/10, The door cards are black still and dash is cracked. Mechanically sound and reliable. The head was rebuilt by Reno Rennsport some time back but there is no timing belt sticker so that is my next project. No fluid leaks!\n\nRecent work done within last 5k:\nNew spark plugs\nNew rear shock mounts\nNew fan clutch\nNew water pump\nNew thermostat\nNew alternator and belt (only accessory belt)\nTrans and diff fluids changed\nCoolant flush\nBrake fluid flushed twice with DOT4\nRebuilt fuel injectors\nNew 325i Rotors with Hawk HPS street pads and Girling calipers\nLeather comfort seats 9/10 condition\nResealed oil filter housing\nFresh oil change last weekend\nFull clay bar, buff and wax\nNew all season tires\nNew control arm bushings\nNew ZHP shift knob\n\nImperfections: (I am working on these things until sold)\nCracked dash\nGauge cluster needs to be smacked like most e30s\npaint has been resprayed and there are small imperfections\nSunroof handle works but does not stay up and is missing the trim around the handle\nhvac lights intermittently work\ndrivers high beam is cracked\nSun visor clips broken\n\nThis car is great for someone with a collection or looking to start one. Or you can go the other way and have a perfectly straight body for a swap of your choice. My intent was to get it as perfect as possible and just enjoy having a different E30. I am asking 4k and the car is worth much more especially fully restored."
reno_/_tahoe,https://sacramento.craigslist.org/cto/d/1985-bmw-325e-e30/6485687894.html,"This is a 1985 BMW 325e E30. It has a 2.7 I6 and a 5 speed manual transmission. The car was towed by the city over a year ago and was bought as a project. Prior to having a lien title, it had a clean record and title. The body and interior not bad and the paint is better than most comparable E30s. Odometer does not work and stopped at 147,539, so the actual mileage is unknown. There are 2 important issues with the car that I do not have time to correct. The flange on the back of the transmission is damaged due to the flex disk between it and the drive shaft breaking, therefore the transmission and driveshaft are not connected. I have a new flex disk and the bolts to put it back on. The other issue is how the car runs. It runs but it runs rough, requiring throttle input to stay running. I do not know what has caused this issue and don't have the time to correct it. Throughout the car there are other smaller issues, most of them unimportant. Other small repairs that will need to get done include reattaching the hood and replacing the drivers side rear brake caliper, the bleeder valve is broken but I already have a replacement caliper. The left front hub will need to re re-tapped for the remaining 2 lug nuts and the right front shock needs one more nut to hold it on and fix the alignment. Any other issues I am not aware of. You will need to tow it yourself. Text is preferred.\n\n$1900 OBO\nWill trade for motorcycle or a reasonable condition car.\n\nI currently cannot locate my title, so be aware"

Car comes with a mostly complete E36 with 98k thats right 98k miles. I've sold a few things off it (E36) but everything needed for a carb legal swap is still there (all emissions stuff included). All of the mechanical stuff is out of the E36 and ready for the swap. E36 has a salvage title and I bought it wrecked and running from the auction. As for the E30, it's a clean title, complete but it's not currently running. It was having some fuel delivery issues before I decided to do the swap. I can't recall the mileage on the car but it's around 300k. I'm not looking to sell the parts or sell the cars separately. I need it all gone. Need to tow both. I'll take any reasonable offers."

Classic lines and it looks great on the streets, as well as a pleasure to drive.\n\nThe car has been in upstate NY as well as MA. Unsure of its full background but it seems to have stayed in New England for most of its life. A lot of work has been done - it was not running when purchased. Work included structural welding, rust repair, brakes, and engine. Minimal rust on the paint, however, the rocker panels and underside are weathered, aside from the newly replaced floorpans. Interior is in good shape with only a small rip in the driver's seat. Missing a few parts including a proper center console (I have the ash-tray and hazard button), and some smaller pieces on the doors such as window crank knobs. Up until last year, it started and ran reliably. The car has sat for a little over a year in my driveway, and most likely needs a battery charge to start back up - I just haven't had the time/money to put into it.

The previous owner did a lot of work in restoring the car and modernizing the suspension. Most of the work was done by Ken Blasko of BMW Vintage Racing in Long Beach California. He's a small shop who races 2002s and he does fantastic work.\n\nThe previous owner put in all new suspension with Bilstein HDs and HR Sport springs, new front brakes (stock) and revamped the rears. The engine has been rebuilt from the top up with a surfaced and smoothed 121 head, new Weber 38/38, custom 292 cam, Pertronix electronic ignition, new valve springs and rockers, and new gaskets. All of that work has been done by Ken.\n\nIn October 2016 it was dynoed and it put down 109 HP and 120 lbs/ft torque to the wheels, which puts it at tii levels.\n\nThe second owner did a pretty great job at hacking it and ugly-fying it, which we haven't done much to address. It was originally Sahara Tan, but the original owner had it painted Agave Green, and then the second owner put the current Chamonix White coat over it. It's a decent 10-foot job with ok shine, but it definitely isn't show car pretty.\n\nAs far as I can tell, there isn't much rust. The spare wheel well was starting to rust through a bit, so I sanded down everything and coated it in Por15. There's slight bubbling on the passenger door sill as well, but that's all I've found.\n\nThe second owner redid the interior with E21 Recaros in grey tweed and black vinyl. I think it actually looks pretty cool, but it isn't original. The carpet was pretty grungy, so I tore it out and stripped the interior down to the metal. There was a small portion of floorboard rust in the driver's footwell which I had cut out and repaired by a shop. I sanded down a few small surface rust areas and then coated the entire interior with Por15 before installing all new sound deadening from RAAMaudio and a carpet from Esty. It's all wired up for sound, and I have the pieces for the center console, but I haven't gotten around to having a front panel made yet.\nThe second owner installed an E21 radiator and an E21 5-speed manual (I believe it's a 245), which the third owner improved by adding a shift assembly out of a Z3 - that work was done by Coast Motor Werks in Irvine.\n\nNow for the bad (every vintage car has some bad, right?)...\nThe biggest current need is a new set of piston rings. The exhaust will blow smoke out if you decelerate on throttle at 4000+ RPM. After having the engine gone through by Ken and having the entire top end rebuilt, we've narrowed the problem down to the piston rings. Ken has assured me that it's not something to worry about, but it should be addressed sometime in the future.\n\nThe next thing I would address is the thermostat. Under most conditions, the engine runs along just fine, but after flogging it up and down a canyon or stop and go traffic on an 85deg+ day, the car gets a bit warmer than I'd like. I haven't been able to get the engine temperature into the red, but it gets pretty hot under those circumstances. I've had the radiator leak and pressure tested, and the thermostat replaced. I think it's time to get an aluminum radiator and electric fan to keep the temp down.\n\nOther than that, the second owner saw fit to outfit the car with a few... questionable styling decisions (misfitting spoiler, blacked-out grills, American flag sticker on the back), but nothing too crazy.\n\nTires are all brand new Toyo T1Rs (less than 2000 miles on them) and fluids have always been changed at the appropriate times.\n\nFeel free to text or email with any questions."

This is my favorite car to drive by some life changes have forced me to part ways with it. This was my second 91 318is that I bought about 2 years ago. The person I bought the car from was the 3rd owner, making me the 4th. The previous owner had done the swap, not done by me. The following is a list of things that were done by the previous owner as well as a few that I have done over the past couple years.\n\n-All original paint - basically no clear coat left, looks great polished and waxed but needs routine care to really shine without clearcoat.\n-Body has over 248k - odometer stopped working around there and I have not yet fixed it, if I had to guess, probably another 20k.\n\nPrevious Owner:\n-Engine is 95 m50 with s52 cams and tune around 120k, new crank sensor, temp sensor,o2 all gaskets replaced besides head gasket.\n-Zf trans, previous owner was told by reputable shop that he purchased it from that it was rebuilt and probably has around 20k.\n-Smoothed bay\n-All 4 wheel bearings done\n-New OE clutch kit, slave, slave line and slave master\n-Zimmerman drilled rotors\n-Hawk pads\n-Ecs lines\n-Rev shift poly bushings through out undercarriage\n-E.I. adjustable trailing arm tabs\n-Long tube headers with custom 2.5""exhaust MagnaFlow muffler and cat\n-Mtech sport steering wheel\n\nSince I have owned:\n-New radiator, water pump, housing, thermostat, radiator fan switch, upper & lower hoses.\n-Antenna Gromet\n-New shift linkage bushings\n-Aftermarket Stereo (original stopped working, still have it)\n-Euro Clock\n-Correct(used) driveshaft\n-New center support bearing\n-New guibo(rubber driveshaft flex disc)\n\nOther things to mention:\nNo power steering\nNo air condition\nHeater control valve needs to be replaced (causes heat to be a little temperamental).\nCarpet is original and has stains\nSport seats are in pretty good shape, however, drivers seat does have some rips and tears (see photos)\nDash has cracks (see photos)\nSpeakers are going\nValve cover has begun to leak a little oil\nExhaust could use some work - cat was removed and replaced with just a temporary piece of straight pipe, doesn't sound great but its not too loud and obnoxious either.\n\nAnd I am sure there are other things that I am forgetting. Repairs I had done were done by Mr. M Car in Wall Township, NJ. He is a great BMW mechanic who specializes in BMW performance cars and has completed a number of these swaps in the past.\n\nI am motivated to sell this car because it pains me to see it sitting in my driveway knowing it won't be there forever. I am willing to negotiate for reasonable offers and not interested in trades(but you can try anyway just don't tell my wife). If you are serious about possibly purchasing this car and would like to arrange to see it in person please let me know.

The following is a list of things that were done by the previous owner as well as a few that I have done over the past couple years.\n\n-All original paint - basically no clear coat left, looks great polished and waxed but needs routine care to really shine without clearcoat.\n-Body has over 248k - odometer stopped working around there and I have not yet fixed it, if I had to guess, probably another 20k.\n\nPrevious Owner:\n-Engine is 95 m50 with s52 cams and tune around 120k, new crank sensor, temp sensor,o2 all gaskets replaced besides head gasket.\n-Zf trans, previous owner was told by reputable shop that he purchased it from that it was rebuilt and probably has around 20k.\n-Smoothed bay\n-All 4 wheel bearings done\n-New OE clutch kit, slave, slave line and slave master\n-Zimmerman drilled rotors\n-Hawk pads\n-Ecs lines\n-Rev shift poly bushings through out undercarriage\n-E.I. adjustable trailing arm tabs\n-Long tube headers with custom 2.5""exhaust MagnaFlow muffler and cat\n-Mtech sport steering wheel\n\nSince I have owned:\n-New radiator, water pump, housing, thermostat, radiator fan switch, upper & lower hoses.\n-Antenna Gromet\n-New shift linkage bushings\n-Aftermarket Stereo (original stopped working, still have it)\n-Euro Clock\n-Correct(used) driveshaft\n-New center support bearing\n-New guibo(rubber driveshaft flex disc)\n\nOther things to mention:\nNo power steering\nNo air condition\nHeater control valve needs to be replaced (causes heat to be a little temperamental).\nCarpet is original and has stains\nSport seats are in pretty good shape, however, drivers seat does have some rips and tears (see photos)\nDash has cracks (see photos)\nSpeakers are going\nValve cover has begun to leak a little oil\nExhaust could use some work - cat was removed and replaced with just a temporary piece of straight pipe, doesn't sound great but its not too loud and obnoxious either.\n\nAnd I am sure there are other things that I am forgetting. Repairs I had done were done by Mr. M Car in Wall Township, NJ. He is a great BMW mechanic who specializes in BMW performance cars and has completed a number of these swaps in the past.\n\nI am motivated to sell this car because it pains me to see it sitting in my driveway knowing it won't be there forever. I am willing to negotiate for reasonable offers and not interested in trades(but you can try anyway just don't tell my wife). If you are serious about possibly purchasing this car and would like to arrange to see it in person please let me know. For location, the Wegmans in Ocean Township on Route 35 is less than a mile away. Email, Call, Text.\n\nThanks for looking."

Previous owner installed poly motor mounts as well as poly mounts and bushings in the rear end.The LSD in the car has been recently serviced. The car is on a full set of Yellow Speed Racing Dynamic Pro Sport coil overs with a 5 lug conversion. New pads with drilled and slotted rotors from ebc.

utica-rome-oneida,https://albany.craigslist.org/cto/d/89-bmw-e30-m60-swap-lela/6478392262.html,Lela was originally built by Garagistic out of Wesminster CA.\nAfter being sold and appreciated by new owner she experienced an engine fire which led to the engine being replaced with another M60 and the replacement of the interior. She was also repainted and the wheels were swapped out. This led to the issue of a Salvage Title which she still obtains. We had purchased her afterwards as another of too many projects. Due to another upcoming project we will have to let her go. We have not done anything to her and had hoped to enjoy her on the track. Currently from what we see she needs some work done with the IP cluster as several of the main indicators are not functioning and the front fenders need a little adjustment. She runs and drives although she is currently not registered with DMV. Please have a look at the link below to see what she had done to her by Garagistic. All reasonable offers will be considered.\n\nIn NYS A vehicle with a salvage title can still be registered after being inspected by the State.\n\nhttp://garagistic.com/index.php?page=lela---m60-b40-6-speed-e30\n\nContact Ryan\n5one8-944-zero3nine9

This is a CA car originally brought to the east coast by a collector in the mid 2000s when it was bought from the original owner with 150,000 miles on the car. It has been meticulously maintained throughout its life (I have receipts from its first services back in the late 80s) and since my ownership it has seen a lot of tasteful upgrades. The car has about 190k on the chassis but over the winter of 2015 (about 30k ago) I had the head built at a local shop and a bottom end refresh. The car has a schrick 284, HD rocker arms, and upgraded valve spings. Its a beautiful example of an e30 and I haven't seen a cleaner example in such original condition. The car is 99% rust free, has a crack free dash, original bronzit beige paint (which is in good condition but has its imperfections) , and a black sport interior (condition 9/10).\n\nAbout the car:\n190k on chassis 30k on head rebuild (Timing belt and water pump done at the same time)\nSitting on 16x8 e38 style 5s with e30sport 5 lug adapters\nHR Race and Bilstein sports\nCondor Speed Shop solid motor/trans mounts\nFront suspension refresh last winter (tie rods, control arms, strut mounts, front/rear end links.

Im sure I'm missing some stuff so shoot me a text and lets talk. This is an extremely clean example of an e30 and Ive really tried my best to keep the car nice.\n\nI'm looking for an e36 m3 coupe after this so if you have any leads or a car you'd consider selling/ trading I'm interested.\n\nI also have an 1982 320i e21 listed on Lexington Kentucky's craigslist! check it out!\nhttps://lexington.craigslist.org/cto/d/1982-bmw-320i-e21/ show contact info .html\n\nThanks for looking!"

cleveland,https://cleveland.craigslist.org/cto/d/1976-bmw-2002/6455687572.html,"I am selling this absolutely beautiful 1976 BMW 2002! I bought this car and was going to put flares on it and do an engine swap with big brakes, wheels ... etc. It is way to clean to molest in such a way. So I have turned my attention to a 2002 that is not finished for my project. My loss is your gain! Below is what was advertised when I bought the car:\n\n""1976 BMW 2002, This BMW has been well restored to excellent condition with tasteful upgrades in late 1990's. This 2002 is has a wonderfully documented history showing every single penny spent on the car from 1976 to 1997 when it was taken off the road. The records start back up in 2014 when the car was once again regularly used. Of course, all of the original books come with the car, including the original brochure. The car was delivered new with a sunroof and a four speed. It was manufactured on September 23, 1975 and delivered on October 9, 1975. The car was originally Fjord Metallic. It has traveled 100,213 miles since new. The car was the subject of a recent restoration. The work included a very nice paint job in BMW Atlantis Metallic, a complete engine rebuild by Korman Autoworks in Greensboro, NC, added headers and center exhaust, also by Korman, Bilstein shocks, BMW E21 Recaro Seats, a Nardi steering wheel and shift knob, a Zender turbo style front and rear fascia, euro style rear bumper, euro style front and rear markers, goreous Enki J speed wheels, an Esty carpet kit, rear strut brace, new gas tank, new tie rods, Weber carburetor, and a Sony stereo. This is a beautifully restored, well preserved and documented example of BMW's treasured classic. The body is all original and shows no signs of rust or repairs. The car bears only minor imperfections, including stone chips, very minor cracking on the dasboard, and two small upholstery tears, one in the driver seat and one in the rear seat. Chrome is in fantastic condition and all of the mechanical components are in good working order. The car was recently inherited upon the death of a relative and now is for sale to someone who appreciates a classic BMW sedan.""\n\nTake a look at the pics... you will be hard pressed to find a cleaner 2002 anywhere.

These are hard to find.\nPros:\nIt's an E30!\nThe body is in reasonably good condition for a 32 year old car (was resprayed 3 years ago). Some rust on the rocker seams, but nothing major.\nLeather interior\nSport Package with LSD and M sport suspension\nUp-to-date maintenance\nRuns well, shifts nicely\nHeat works\nCons:\nElectronics are finnicky (Window is slow, power locks don't work, and the some speakers come in and out)\nPower steering pump is weak\nA/C is weak, Has been converted to r134a, and compressor rebuilt, but it doesn't work too well. Fan is squeaky\nCracked dash, cracked leather.\nOdometer gears are broken. All other gauges are reliable"

The records start back up in 2014 when the car was once again regularly used. Of course, all of the original books come with the car, including the original brochure. The car was delivered new with a sunroof and a four speed. It was manufactured on September 23, 1975 and delivered on October 9, 1975. The car was originally Fjord Metallic. It has traveled 100,213 miles since new. The car was the subject of a recent restoration. The work included a very nice paint job in BMW Atlantis Metallic, a complete engine rebuild by Korman Autoworks in Greensboro, NC, added headers and center exhaust, also by Korman, Bilstein shocks, BMW E21 Recaro Seats, a Nardi steering wheel and shift knob, a Zender turbo style front and rear fascia, euro style rear bumper, euro style front and rear markers, goreous Enki J speed wheels, an Esty carpet kit, rear strut brace, new gas tank, new tie rods, Weber carburetor, and a Sony stereo. This is a beautifully restored, well preserved and documented example of BMW's treasured classic. The body is all original and shows no signs of rust or repairs. The car bears only minor imperfections, including stone chips, very minor cracking on the dasboard, and two small upholstery tears, one in the driver seat and one in the rear seat. Chrome is in fantastic condition and all of the mechanical components are in good working order.

The car is in good overall cosmetic condition considering the age and runs great. The vehicle does not leak oil or any other fluids and is pretty sound mechanically. The interior is in exceptional shape with the exception of the drivers side seat which has been taped. The dash has some cracks and scratches and some of the vent settings i do not believe work but the heater works fine and believe it or not the air conditioner condenser kicks down when you turn the AC on. {It doesn't blow cold and i dont know if it will even hold freon} so it is not guaranteed.the radio works great but unsure if the tape deck does. The sunroof works with a little careful assistance. I've only had the car a short time but the title is ready to transfer. The 4 cylinder engine is clean and fuel efficient. I cant warrantee this vehicle because of its age, but ive had no trouble starting this car and everything seems sound. The car does need a little TLC to return it to excellent condition (see photos) Cash only!!!no out of state crap and if you are a nigerian princess move along. The price is somewhat negotiable. Also i have a fairly good idea what its worth so please don't insult me by offering 500.00 or something like that. All serious offers will be considered.

These were changed by me in the last 6 months. Previous owner claimed to take very good care of it which is believable based on how it feels, sounds, and drives.\n\nCons:\n-Faded paint job on the hood, roof, and trunk\n-Speedo doest work\n-Odometer stopped at 195,XXX and the previous owner said he didn't drive it much when it stopped and said its at about 205,xxx k miles. I put at the most about 2000 miles on since owning it.\n-Muffler has a hole, hense an exhaust leak (which doesn't sound all that bad)\n-Minor dents in some areas\n-When all lights are on, the left side markers are constantly on (not flashing, just on). From what I know, its the park lights but who knows why they were triggered. So for now, I have that fuse out so my left tail light is never on, unless I hit the breaks. I mean what do you want, its a 33 year old car!\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions that weren't answered through the ad, feel free to ask. I prefer text because I'm working most of the time, so I'll answer as best I can. Im not TOO firm on the price but it doesn't mean you can low ball.

So cooling is currently rerouted deleting heater core.\n-New right rear wheel bearing, and axle. I did these, but it turned out the noise was coming from the Differential. Still runs, still corners, however needs a rebuild.\n-Have spare rear bumper with a hitch bolted to it quite literally. Wired up for trailer lights. However, after sitting for so long blinkers don't seem to work.\n\nEngine Rebuild: Currently at 32k miles on this engine build,\n-1984 2.7l 325e Block\n-1987 325i 885 Head w/ Ireland Engineering Valves: 42mm Intake, 36mm Exhaust -Rebuilt by local shop.

Previous owner claimed to take very good care of it which is believable based on how it feels, sounds, and drives.\n\nCons:\n-Faded paint job on the hood, roof, and trunk\n-Speedo doest work\n-Odometer stopped at 195,XXX and the previous owner said he didn't drive it much when it stopped and said its at about 205,xxx k miles. I put at the most about 2000 miles on since owning it.\n-Muffler has a hole, hense an exhaust leak (which doesn't sound all that bad)\n-Minor dents in some areas\n-When all lights are on, the left side markers are constantly on (not flashing, just on). From what I know, its the park lights but who knows why they were triggered. So for now, I have that fuse out so my left tail light is never on, unless I hit the breaks. I mean what do you want, its a 33 year old car!\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions that weren't answered through the ad, feel free to ask. I prefer text because I'm working most of the time, so I'll answer as best I can. Im not TOO firm on the price but it doesn't mean you can low ball. NO TRADES and NOT PARTING OUT.\nI'll throw in a pair of extra wheels with tires too. They're the same as the ones on the car currently."

I am a 34 year member of the BMWCCA and have an extensive knowledge of these wonderful cars. I have owned and restored several over this time period.\n\nLocally purchased in 2008, as an abandoned project, hundreds of hours and years of enjoyment have gone into sorting, sourcing and ""upfixing"". Having incredibly good bones, little body damage and very little tin worm intrusion, this jewel was a great candidate for a renewed life.\n\nAll welding, body repair and finishing work was completed by me. The primer coats and color coats (PPG Deltron base/clear system in Colorado paint code 002) were applied professionally. This was, of course, a ""glass out"" project. After paint, all new rubber seals were installed.\n\nAll aluminum belt line trim, pillar finishers, drip rails and grilles were restored and polished by me. Front and rear bumpers (ends and center pieces) were sent out for replating.\n\nThe car has a perky, numbers matching M10 motor with a 121t head, mated to a smooth shifting stock 4-speed trans with no issues. With the water choke 32/36 Weber carb and tii exhaust manifold, for better exhaust flow, the car pulls hard and makes good power with no smoke on ""accel or decel"". The NGK BP6ES plugs maintain a nice tan color (as inspected after ""spirited"" driving.) Please be advised that the number of miles on the chassis and engine were not documented by the prior owner. As this is now a 40+ plus year old car, I am sure it has traveled 100,000+ miles.\n\nThe front end was re-bushed with poly bushings and new ball joints were installed. The car was aligned and tracks dead straight at all speeds. The front sway bar is 17 mm (stock) and rear sway bar is 19 mm. With H&R springs, Bilstein shocks and the sway bar set up, the car is very capable and nimble.\n\nThe tires are new 185/70/13 Yokohama AVID T4 radials. They are mounted on stock steel wheels.\n\nNew brake and clutch hydraulics have been installed. New brake calipers, rotors and brake master cylinder were fitted.\n\nThe floorboards were stripped bare, sanded, metal prepped, primed and finish coated. New sound deadening material was then installed. To help reduce road noise further, the new factory correct salt and pepper carpet was fitted with 1/2 inch insulation padding.\n\nThe upper dash (two piece dash) was restored by me as it had typical cracking in the center near the gauge cluster. The lower dash and glove box pieces are both close to pristine original condition.\n\nThe seats, front and back, are correct, non-ripped, black basket weave vinyl.\n\nAfter the car returned from paint, a new factory correct off-white snakeskin vinyl headliner, sourced from World Upholstery, was professionally installed.\n\nThe front, unsafe, 1971 specific ""spaghetti"" style seat belts were removed. Later model BMW 2002 retractable belts were retrofitted...really a nice upgrade providing comfort and safety.\n\nA very nice stock center console is fitted with a Blaupunkt San Diego AM/FM/CD player. Blaupunkt speakers were installed on the parcel shelf.\n\nAll lights, instruments, switches, gauges and heater work as they should. Headlights are restored Bosch H4's.\n\nThe battery was moved to the trunk.\n\nThe trunk boards are re-covered in light gray vinyl as originally fitted..\n\nThe car will be sold with a decent spare tire, a factory jack and a lug wrench. Also, included will be a back up pair of sealed beam halogen headlights and the remaining Deltron paint for future touch up needs.\n\nI hold the clear Washington title in my name. The car is presently licensed with collector plates.\n\nWith round tail light car prices as they are on the ""up tick"", as documented by sources such as Hagerty and the NADA classic car price guides and closed internet auctions, I believe my, ""now revised"", asking price is quite fair based on the present condition of my car in comparison to those few other early 2002's in similar condition that I have encountered on the internet marketplace. I am, however, willing to listen to offers within reason.\n\nBeing old school, I prefer dealing face to face locally and do not wish to consider internet auction venues just yet.\nI do not need help selling my car.....so brokers and dealers need not apply.\nI am ""thinning my herd"" so, no....I am not looking to trade.\nWith the asking price as it is, I prefer to deal with serious buyers....principals only..\n\nSeller contacts:\nPlease feel free to text your ""questions"" about the car to show contact info . Please do not text ""offers"" as they will be ignored and deleted.\nTo view and inspect my car, please call between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm and leave a clear voice message with return phone number on my land line, show contact info . All phone calls will be returned within 12 hours.\n\nThanks for looking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

The original thermostat for the car runs at the 3/4 spot (remember it is cold in Europe so the car runs hotter) so it was changed to the 524td (American) thermostat which has the needle at half.Mileage was 161272 kilos.\n\n06/16: New Garagistic shift bushings. Mileage was 162621 kilos.\n\n09/16: Style 10 rims professionally refinished and new tires. Mileage was 163530 kilos.\n\nThe Bad -The car is over 30 years old and has some minor issues with some small spots on the body that need to be treated. I think the clear coat may have worn as it is hard to get stains from leaves off. Nothing major. I had planned to take it to Maaco to refresh it, take care of the small spots, and get a new clear coat but never got to it. -This a Euro car. It does not have air conditioning.\n-When the car is cold the brake light comes on. When it warms up the light goes off. Research shows that this is a common problem and has to do with the solder on the connection. I have never had the time to do this project. But there is a youtube video that walks you through this if that is a problem for you.\n-The lower seat heater and the power antennae do not work. I had replaced the antennae when i first got the car but those things don't hold up for long.\n-Parts can be challenging to get but I have a c.d. that dealers use. You put in the VIN and it gives you the part numbers. This helps find parts easier. Some parts are available in the U.S. because of the Amercian available 524TD. It used the same engine. But others have to be found on Ebay or searching the internet and most of the time come from England or Germany.\n\nPlease email any questions. No Shipping is available. You must make arrangements to pick the vehicle up in Saint Marys, Georgia. The listed price is my lowest acceptable price. Thanks for looking."

chattanooga,https://atlanta.craigslist.org/sat/cto/d/1989-bmw-325i-convertible-98k/6486840638.html,"True Classic Car!!! This car has only 98,267 Original Miles, 2nd Owner, Kameleon Custom Paint including door jams, trunk, & motor compartment. Absolutely no body damage on this vehicle. Painted only because original Schwarz black paint had been polished so much over the years it needed paint on it. Every time I drove it, I always wanted to polish it so I changed the color. I personally painted this car myself, I am a professional of 33 years and have owned this vehicle since 12/13/1997. It is my baby and only drive it on nice days, never in the rain unless I get caught out in it, and garage kept. I painted it about 8 years ago and is in excellent condition. Interior is in excellent condition except slight wear on drivers seat where you get in and out. Top is in excellent shape, I replaced at the same time as painting with BMW original equipment. Custom 17"" Alba Alloy wheels with low profile Falken tires with excellent tread. I also have the original wheels and original stereo if you want them. It has a aftermarket Kenwood stereo with cassette with a 10 cd changer in the trunk along with a bazooka bass and small amp. It has the tool kit in the trunk and still has all the original tools in it, and has never been used. This vehicle has always been adult driven, Inline 6, 5 speed manual. Timing belt was done at 50k. Glass is good, headlights are not chipped, metal bumpers are in excellent condition, all moldings and rubber around windows are excellent.\nPictures doesn't do the Kameleon paint any justice but predominate colors are green to purple and in between colors, more noticeable at low sun are blue, copper, maroon, and gold/chartreuse. At a distance it can look black. This vehicle is very classy and sporty, and I don't see anyone having one any nicer than this one - it turns heads everywhere you go so if you don't like people looking at you or talking to people then this isn't the vehicle for you. I have it insured through Grundy Collector Vehicle Insurance for 15k. I have the original listing taken off the window from BMW to Village BMW in Chattanooga, TN showing all the features and the total suggested retail price new was $34,340.00. Asking $6900.00"

I will list everything I did to it below. I have not been able to drive this car but a few hundred miles. It has an M52 engine swap with a ZF transmission from an e36. The previous owner did the engine swap and it has run strong for me ever since. It was meant to be a fun weekend/track car but I have never taken it to the track. The interior is stripped with racing seats and harnesses.\n\nThe Good:\n- M52 and ZF transmission\n- *Ground Control suspension ($2300). I can provide more information about spring rates if needed\n- *UUC Sway Bars\n- *TRMotorsport C1 15x8 wheels with star spec tires ($1100)\n- *UUC Short Shift kit\n- *Rebuilt brakes with new stoptech pads and SS brake lines\n- *Poly Bushing everywhere\n- *Camber and Toe adjustment tabs on rear subframe\n- *All front and rear wheel bearings\n- *Rebuilt Rear drive axles\n- *Resealed 2.93 LSD\n\nEverything with an * only has 200-300 miles on it so it is basically brand new.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Interior Stripped\n- Body needs work. Again, basically no rust but the previous owner repainted and could have done a better job.\n- No power steering or AC. Heat still works.\n- Needs alignment. I installed the camber and toe tabs so the car could be aligned properly but never got around to it\n- There is no exhaust on the car currently. It is just open headers.\n\nI'm sure there is more that I'm forgetting but I will add as I remember. Basically, the car is set up to be a perfectly performing car but unfortunately I was unable to finish the work due to my time constraints and lack of a garage. I will not part the car out."

Obd1 M50 swap was done by a previous owner and runs perfectly now that i've Replaced a few key relays, as well as cleaned the MAF and ICV(a pain but worth the perfect idle).... I also recently installed a meyle water pump(metal impeller) and thermostat(160). Has water and water wetter in it right now and runs just below half no matter how hard you beat on it. No coolant leaks at all. Also has Headers and full exhaust which sounds awesome. Uses stock 325 transmission, has been popping out of first gear lately when it's ice cold. Other than that, no grinds or anything once you're rolling. All gauges work but the speedo. Check panel works as well but OBC needs screen repair. Has a stock open diff in it but I have both a 2.93lsd and a welded diff that can be included for a couple hundred extra.

chattanooga,https://atlanta.craigslist.org/atl/cto/d/1987-bmw-e28-535i-manual-5/6484391168.html,"I purchased this car early this year from the fourth owner who is a doctor in New York. The second owner of this vehicle was a BMW master mechanic who basically did most of the modifications and repairs on this car about 7 years /36k miles ago. The third owner was a BMW collector in Florida who has many older vintage bmws so he sold this one. The chassis and body have somewhere around 200k miles on it from what the carfax shows me, but there has been a lot of work done to the car before I purchased it, and they follow here:\n\nEngine:\nRebuilt 36k miles/ 8-9 years ago by 2nd owner who was the bmw master tech, I have most the parts purchased receipts for this\nComplete head rework with aftermarket valve springs, valve retainers, and schrick cams\nNew piston rings, rod and crank bearings, head gasket, engine seals, alternator\nConverted to MAF with miller motorsports maf and WAR chip\nExhaust:\nFull Supersprint exhaust and headers\nAdditional Parts:\nclutch and flywheel\nfan clutch and radiator\ndriveshaft\nfuel pump and regulator\nslave and master cylinder\nFront End:\nupper and lower control arms\nsway and steering bar links\nSuspension\nH&R Springs with Bilstein damper\nBody:\nDiamond black metallic paint job about 9 years (Car was Sapphire blue metallic originally I think)\nNew door and trunk rubber seals\nEuropean Front valance\nEuropean Spec front and rear bumper\nEuro headlights and fog lights\nE28 M5 shadowline door trim\nInterior:\nEuro M5 leather dashboard (I think its started to crack under the leather)\nReupholstered leather front power sport and back seats\nNew alcantra headliner\nM dash cluster\nM metal pedal box and shift knob\nKenwood headunit with bluetooth and new front speakers\nNew front driver window motor\n\nNow the cons that the local BMW shop informed me of:\nSome rust on the shocks and front thrust arms of the car,\npower steering hoses and filters will need to be changed in the near future\nDiff gasket, Oil pan and filter gasket will be need replacement in the near future (gasket is saturating a little, not dripping yet).\nWill need new tires (current tires are bald and dry rotting),\nNew A/C switch and A/C recharge, blows cool air not cold, and witch only stays on sometimes\nInterior trim under steering wheel is drooping\nMissing clips to hold in trunk liner\nFinally passenger window is not working\n\nI did many reliability repairs when I purchased the car because I originally planned to daily drive it. I had the following replaced early this year and only drove a few hundred miles since:\nbattery\nspark plugs\nnew distributor cap and rotor\nnew water pump, new belts and new hoses\nnew coolant temperature sensor\nnew shift link seal\nnew valve cover gasket and valve adjustment\nChanged almost all the lights and put in new seals\nInstalled a refurbished computer board for the dash.\nFinally got a new tune from Markert Motorwerks for the WAR chip.\nAll the work I got done was done by Market which is a local BMW specialist shop. I have all the paperwork for this recent work and some for work done by the previous owners. Car currently has about 38K miles and about 9 years on most the rebuild.\n\nI am selling because plans changed, I need to drive further and more for work and school now. So I purchased a newer automatic car to daily drive, and I do not wish to insure and drive 2 cars so I am selling this one. The car mechanically runs and drives great now, except for the bads but everything else should last a long time. The interior id say is a 7-8/10 condition for a 25yr old car due to the some of the buttons having wear, carpets have wear. Exterior Id say is 6/10. Looks great from 5-10feet away but upon closer inspection there are some small scratches, dents and micro scratches. Probably could be a 7-8/10 with a good polish job. Please let me know if you are interested or have any more questions or if you would like more photos because I have many more."

Just had timing belt and water pump done just because it has been sitting for few years in the garage, newer paint, sound reducing mat installation first before new carpet kit, tinted windows.\n\nI just don't like the color and I live on a dirt road now and don't want to drive it home?"
austin,https://austin.craigslist.org/cto/d/bmw-e30-sedan-s52-swap-price/6476312130.html,"It has unfortunately become time to part ways with my e30. I recently purchased an e46 M3 and have decided that it will be replacing the e30's spot in my heart & garage.\n\nI acquired the body & had the swap performed at Terry Sayther BMW, here in Austin TX. The drivetrain was originally in another e30 that met an untimely end during some spirited driving out in our hill country. That car was full of rust so I decided to take the opportunity to move its drivetrain into a rust-free body. TS took care of 95% of the swap and the car runs and drives great. The donor body is a 1- owner TX car that I purchased from the shop.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- OBD I Converted S52\n- No leaks\n- ~105k miles on engine/transmission\n- Clutch/flywheel were replaced during original swap ~95k miles\n- Turner Motorsports drilled/slotted rotors all around\n- H&R Sport Cup spring & shock set\n- Ebay headers into 3"" Straight pipe exhaust - sounds fantastic\n- KA Motors intake & headlight adapter\n- Heated sport seats in pretty good shape\n- Manual sunroof\n- Crack-free dash\n- Body is pretty straight overall with only a few minor dings\n- No rust!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Clearcoat is mostly gone\n- Needs the gauge cluster swapped\n- Body dings as pictured\n- Passenger power window is inop, drivers works great, rears are slow but functional\n- Small power steering leak\n- Needs AC compressor, otherwise system is functional according to TS\n- Open 2.93 diff\n- Radiator could use replacing\n- Hood support strut needs to be replaced\n\nThe Extras:\n\n- 3 K1 wheels with good tires (last rim was broken)\n- Mtech Steering wheel\n- Ebay HID kit\n- Late model bumpers\n- Full set of bushings\n- Car cover\n\nThis set up is amazing fun to drive and extremely fast. This car has the potential to be an excellent example of an e30 with some fresh paint and a few details sorted out. I have the original clean TX title for this vehicle in hand. Not in a rush to sell but willing to negotiate. Would love to see this go to someone who will finish this car out, or keep it as a sleeper and embrace its character."

I recently purchased an e46 M3 and have decided that it will be replacing the e30's spot in my heart & garage.\n\nI acquired the body & had the swap performed at Terry Sayther BMW, here in Austin TX. The drivetrain was originally in another e30 that met an untimely end during some spirited driving out in our hill country. That car was full of rust so I decided to take the opportunity to move its drivetrain into a rust-free body. TS took care of 95% of the swap and the car runs and drives great. The donor body is a 1- owner TX car that I purchased from the shop.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- OBD I Converted S52\n- No leaks\n- ~105k miles on engine/transmission\n- Clutch/flywheel were replaced during original swap ~95k miles\n- Turner Motorsports drilled/slotted rotors all around\n- H&R Sport Cup spring & shock set\n- Ebay headers into 3"" Straight pipe exhaust - sounds fantastic\n- KA Motors intake & headlight adapter\n- Heated sport seats in pretty good shape\n- Manual sunroof\n- Crack-free dash\n- Body is pretty straight overall with only a few minor dings\n- No rust!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Clearcoat is mostly gone\n- Needs the gauge cluster swapped\n- Body dings as pictured\n- Passenger power window is inop, drivers works great, rears are slow but functional\n- Small power steering leak\n- Needs AC compressor, otherwise system is functional according to TS\n- Open 2.93 diff\n- Radiator could use replacing\n- Hood support strut needs to be replaced\n\nThe Extras:\n\n- 3 K1 wheels with good tires (last rim was broken)\n- Mtech Steering wheel\n- Ebay HID kit\n- Late model bumpers\n- Full set of bushings\n- Car cover\n\nThis set up is amazing fun to drive and extremely fast. This car has the potential to be an excellent example of an e30 with some fresh paint and a few details sorted out. I have the original clean TX title for this vehicle in hand. Not in a rush to sell but willing to negotiate. Would love to see this go to someone who will finish this car out, or keep it as a sleeper and embrace its character."

Now, 40 years since, she's completely restored and sports a rare German 1980 M90 engine and drivetrain; never driven in the rain.\n\nM90 engine history:\nThe M90 was the first road going BMW engine with 3.5 litre displacement. Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves.

I recently purchased an e46 M3 and have decided that it will be replacing the e30's spot in my heart & garage.\n\nI acquired the body & had the swap performed at Terry Sayther BMW, here in Austin TX. The drivetrain was originally in another e30 that met an untimely end during some spirited driving out in our hill country. That car was full of rust so I decided to take the opportunity to move its drivetrain into a rust-free body. TS took care of 95% of the swap and the car runs and drives great. The donor body is a 1- owner TX car that I purchased from the shop.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- OBD I Converted S52\n- No leaks\n- ~105k miles on engine/transmission\n- Clutch/flywheel were replaced during original swap ~95k miles\n- Turner Motorsports drilled/slotted rotors all around\n- H&R Sport Cup spring & shock set\n- Ebay headers into 3"" Straight pipe exhaust - sounds fantastic\n- KA Motors intake & headlight adapter\n- Heated sport seats in pretty good shape\n- Manual sunroof\n- Crack-free dash\n- Body is pretty straight overall with only a few minor dings\n- No rust!\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Clearcoat is mostly gone\n- Needs the gauge cluster swapped\n- Body dings as pictured\n- Passenger power window is inop, drivers works great, rears are slow but functional\n- Small power steering leak\n- Needs AC compressor, otherwise system is functional according to TS\n- Open 2.93 diff\n- Radiator could use replacing\n- Hood support strut needs to be replaced\n\nThe Extras:\n\n- 3 K1 wheels with good tires (last rim was broken)\n- Mtech Steering wheel\n- Ebay HID kit\n- Late model bumpers\n- Full set of bushings\n- Car cover\n\nThis set up is amazing fun to drive and extremely fast. This car has the potential to be an excellent example of an e30 with some fresh paint and a few details sorted out. I have the original clean TX title for this vehicle in hand. Not in a rush to sell but willing to negotiate. Would love to see this go to someone who will finish this car out, or keep it as a sleeper and embrace its character."

Now, 40 years since, she's completely restored and sports a rare German 1980 M90 engine and drivetrain; never driven in the rain.\n\nM90 engine history:\nThe M90 was the first road going BMW engine with 3.5 litre displacement. Originally this engine was used to test if the M88 engine was reliable with the narrow web spacing of 6.6mm. This means that this engine has exactly the same bore and stroke as the M88 and is directly related. However instead of a DOHC cylinder head with 24 valves, BMW used the SOHC cylinder head with 12 valves.

IF YOU ARE A BROKER AND YOU CALL ME I WILL PUT YOUR PHONE NUMBER ON EVERY JUNK SALES CALL LIST OUT THERE. TO THE POINT YOUR PHONE LINE WILL RING OFF THE HOOK AND BE USELESS! SO JUST DONT WASTE MY TIME OR YOURS!\nI have for sale/trade my 1982 BMW e21 320i. It's a classic BMW you don't see many of any more. I am only the second owner. The original owner parked it in 1996. I have done quite a bit of restoration work on the car. Everything on the car is original. Nothing has been hacked, chopped, nor has the car been mutilated to be a weekend race car, hot rod, etc. This is as close to factory as you will get. The car is Safari Beige. Has the crank sunroof, crank windows, and a manual 5 speed transmission. This year e21 was not carbureted, but had the Bosch Mechanical CIS fuel injection. It has the standard diff (not the LSD), front torsion bar, but no rear torsion bar as was standard for this model year. Has the original molded beige carpet that is still in pretty good condition. Has all its original interior trimp pieces still intact. Also has its original paint job with some touch up done at some point by somebody with suboptimal paint skills. While I have done a lot of work and sunk a lot of money into this car, it still has a lot of work left to be done. I have lost interest in this car and moved on to motorcycles. I just don't have the wallet or time to finish this car the way it deserves to be finished.\n\nI want to save your time and mine so I want to be clear, this is a 35 year old car. It is classified as an antique now in NC and exempt from inspections. But like any 35 year old car, this is NOT to be considered a reliable form of transportation. I say this for the benefit of the young or inexperienced. If you are looking for a car for transportation this car is not for you. You could use this car as a daily driver, sure. But only if you understand that like any 35 year old car, you will be tinkering with it nonstop to keep it running. You will also be pouring a lot of money in it. Parts are getting fewer and farther between. And as years go by they are getting even more expensive. If you are buying this car to tinker with on the weekends as a hobby or to finish restoration and show it, then you are probably looking at the right car. Again I will say this as a warning. If you buy any antique car as your main mode of transportation you will be severely disappointed. Take this from a person who grew up around car nuts who owned a lot of classics. I've had a lot of people come looking at it as a source of transportation. I just want to be very clear if you are bringing that mindset again you will be severely disappointed if plan to use it for that.\n\nWork I have done:\n• New Tires\n• Rebuilt the entire brake system. New brake hoses, new pads and shoes, new wheel cylinders, rebuilt front calipers, new brembo rotors, new ATE master cylinder.\n• Driveline was reconditioned. New driveshaft center bearing and guibo. Transmission was pulled. All new seals where put in the transmission. A new Sachs clutch and pressure plate was installed with new throwout bearing. New clutch slave cylinder was installed. Rear main oil seal on engine was replaced while driveline was apart. Transmission shift bushings were replaced as well.\n• AC system was removed and was replaced with the OEM factory European center console. This includes the CORRECT OEM Behr blocking plate for the heater box. (Not some fudged up custom hack) These cars were designed for Europe and originally did not have AC. When imported to the US AC was added as an afterthought. And the systems barely worked and performed unreliably. They really are just extra weight.\n• Radio was upgraded. Four new pioneer speakers were installed to fit the original speaker holes. A NOS 90's vintage Sony ES stereo and amplifier was installed in the car. All of the original speaker wiring and radio wiring was maintained in case somebody wanted to take the car back to stock at some point. Equipment includes a Sony ES head unit with a built in minidisc player. A Sony ES digital sound processor/preamp was installed as well as two sony 10 disc CD changers. To finish it up a Sony ES Amplifier was installed to drive the speakers. I also have a couple of Sony Minidisc changers for extra $$ if the buying/trading party is interested. The radio system itself is worth over $700 as a collectors item.\n• The notorious hazard switch was replaced with a REAL BMW OEM brand new hazard switch. If you know these cars you know what I'm talking about.\n• All the interior lighting was gone through and fixed. Including new bulbs in the dash and instruments and glove box.\n• New digital cock module in the dash cluster. I literally bought the last BMW original NOS Digital clock unit from the dealer. They had to ship it to me from Germany. Cost me $300\n• Back seat was completely taken apart and re-upholstered with the original seat covers. The steel frames were sand blasted and painted. Burlap was sewn to the frames and all new foam was glued in and custom cut. Original seat covers put in place. Back Seat should be good another 35 years now!\n• Interior was completely removed. One small rust spot in the drivers floor pan was repaired with new welded in metal. (1.5 inches square) The entire floorpan was then waterproofed with POR-15 and then painted over in chassis coat black. Even if the sunroof or windows leak there will never be a rust problem now.\n• Sunroof was reworked, new crank handle and plastic sliders and a new sunroof seal. Car still has the original factory BMW wind diverter for the sunroof.\n• The fuel system was completely rebuilt to new. Both fuel tanks where removed and taken to a professional shop where the insides of the tanks where boiled , cleaned and relined. All new rubber hoses where installed between filler spout and tanks, hoses between tanks, vent hoses. New in tank fuel pump and new Bosch fuel accumulator installed. New temperature sensor and thermo time switch. All new Bosch fuel injectors. I had both the warmup regulator and the Fuel distributor sent to Terry Fletcher at CIS Flow tech for rebuilding. These are the guys Bosch use to rebuild CIS mechanical injection systems for classic cars. Terry has the correct factory equipment and parts and specs and training from Bosch to do the job right. The first time. Fuel system rebuild was over $1200 alone. All rubber hoses, pumps, accumulator, etc where ordered from BMW and OEM.\n• A rebuilt bosch alternator was installed, Battery was replaced new about a year ago.\n• All new rubber under the hood on the engine. All bellows, vacuum hoses, cooling and heating system hoses and belts replaced. All OEM BMW parts.\n• Oil pressure sending unit was leaking bad. It was replaced.\n• New plugs and wires and a new O2 sensor.\n• New rubber window channels for the door windows. Also original BMW.\n• New rubber trunk seal. Original BMW.\n• Climate control box was removed, cleaned out and had all new foam seals installed. Also replaced blower motor and blower motor resistors.\n• All original interior. No rips or tears save one repaired tear on the passenger side seat the size of a quarter.\n• All new Hex mats for the floors from baviarian auto sport in matching colors.\n• New muffler and all new mounting hardware, hangers, and straps. (OEM BMW)\n• New original BMW hat tray for the back. The old one was very sun damaged.\n• New engine cooling fan.\n• New windshield and seal being installed next week.\n\nNow for the BAD. Or things I have not yet fixed:\n• Climate control knob to control upper or lower vents is broken. The climate control plate that fastens to the Bowden cable will need to be replaced due to a broken piece of plastic. The new plastic part with the control is about $250 from the dealer.\n• Sunroof cables are off track. One side of the sunroof is higher by ¼ inch than the other so it doesn't seal shut evenly. This is usually a sign the sunroof cables need replacing.\n• Rear window seal needs replacing. Leaks a slight bit into the trunk.\n• Engine has 190k. It will need to be rebuilt soon. It runs like a champ and has very good compression. But like all old things, it will need rebuilding at some point. Engine does not burn oil.\n• One visor clip is broken and needs replacing.\n• Glovebox latch is busted and needs replacing\n• Rear fly out windows (open out) will need the rubber seals replaced.\n• There is a tiny dime size rust hole in the front driver side fender\n• There is a tiny amount of surface pin prick rust on the driver side back fender. (surface only.)\n• Paint. The car will really need a new paint job soon.\n• Auxiliary cooling fan fails to kick in on super hot days. I suspect the thermal switch in the radiator is bad and will need replacing.\n• There is a slight bearing whine in the rear axle. I can't tell if it's the wheel bearings or the diff bearings. Car comes with a used Differential I sandblasted and repainted.\n• Car may need some suspension work. Ball joints seem fine but they are old. New tires wore on the front on the insides due to alignment issues. Definitely need an alignment. May need new suspension bushings, etc. Bushings for the steering rack and some of the rubber covers could stand to be replaced as well.\n• There was a tiny dent put into the back just under the rear driver side brake light. It was a parking lot hit and run with somebody's bumper it appears. Could easily be popped out.\n• The rear brake light lenses are getting pretty brittle and cracked and will need replacing.\n\n\nI have all the receipts for everything I have done to the car. (I did most of the work except things like the gas tanks, fuel distributor, etc.) Have the orignal maintenance records and manuals I got form the owner including the window sticker.\n\nI would consider a swap for a motorcycle larger thank 500cc. I prefer classic Honda bikes. An old 70's model CB750 four would move to the front of the line."

Car runs wonderfully. There are cosmetic flaws but mechanically it is very sound. The AC and heat work. Radio works. Odometer is accurate and works. Car is incredibly fun to drive but is not a family car and thus I am getting rid of it.\n\nThings that have changed - Radio, leather seat covers for front, steering wheel changed to sport wheel in lieu of sedan airbag wheel. Car was originally brillianrot but the outside has been repainted hellrot. A genuine alpine air dam was added to the front valence and Alpina Kopi wheels were put on. Original non slip diff swapped out for a 3.73 LSD.\nAsking $6600 with wheels. $5400 without (you provide tires/wheels).\n\nThere are a few small spots of rust but otherwise it is in excellent condition.\nInterior seats are cloth and there are a few tears.\nRadio is not seated properly and is loose. Doesn't fall out but it's annoying.\n3.73 LSD is slower than original 4.10, but it handles better.\n\nThis car has not been abused. It's been a daily driver for a few years now. Never autocrossed or tracked. Bought from an enthusiast up north who had bought it for his high school daughter. She didn't like it so he got rid of it.\n\nPlease send me emails if you are interested as I can't always get to my phone. I'm open to offers but please be reasonable. If you want pictures of something specific let me know and I'll oblige."

The body has quite a few bumps and dents (see pictures), the clear coat is peeling on the trunk and on the hood.\n\nIt drives very well, shifts and stops well, too. The tires are OK as well, it has brand new battery.\n\nIf you are looking for a pristine E30, clearly this is not the one. With the prices of these cars getting silly, this is an affordable, cute 325e with low mileage that is NOT a rust bucket. And it is a 5 SPEED!! It has lots of 325iS options like the sport seats, steering wheel and LSD.\n\nBy appointment Only. No Doc Fees. 4,999 D30111\n\n(604) 516-6002"

bellingham,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/rds/cto/d/i-bmw-e12-manual/6476421458.html,"The car was imported from USA very early in it's life and been in BC since.\n\nOver $8000 worth of parts and labour were poured into this car. This is not your average old BMW on Craigslist that everyone says is ""mint"", or ""just needs TLC"", or ""perfect"", ""needs nothing"" etc. I hate those ads, and I hate when people waste my time by telling me that, then I go see the car, and it's junk. In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

bellingham,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/nvn/cto/d/my-beautiful-imperfect-1976/6461359873.html,"1976 BMW 2002, 4-cyl. 1990cc/145hp 2bbl\n\nMy beautiful imperfect '02 is up for sale. This car is a great opportunity to own a part of automotive history. It needs a owner who is willing to put a bit of time and effort into some body work, the car will reward you with many positive attributes like a clean interior and strong mechanicals. This car, when cleaned up would fetch a significantly higher price. Read on and see for yourself, the fundamentals are good and this is car with many features.\n\nI have had the car since 1995, and have used it as my sole transportation for most of those years and drive it daily until recently, its true though, I live less than 10 kms from work.\n\nIn 2011'ish I rear-ended a Miata, I wasn't going quickly so the damage was confined. The insurance company replaced the hood, kidney, front nose clip, radiator (plastic alum upgrade) and electric fan, no other damage, the fender did to sustain even a stress fracture.\n\nIt's a special car with many 'period' upgrades and thoughtful details. It was restored between 2001 and 2002, so the body was straight and rust free in those days with new rubber, door seals, seal around the lights, trunk etc. I removed the reflectors and door bumpers strips and collapsed the bumper shocks so the bumper are close to the body giving the car a more 'Euro spec look' and I added euro turn signals. The car was 'jadegrun' from the factory and remains that colour.\n\n\nEngine & Drivetrain upgrades;\n\nA refined throttle linkage connects a 2bbl syncronous 38/38 downdraft with carefully selected jetting. A port matched manifold with the webbing painstakingly cut out and then powder coated\nSuper Sprint SS headers & resonator\nAggressive cam, still idles well, and pulls strongly from 2,500 up, revs freely\n10:1 compression pistons (engine built by TopEnd Performance)\nUpgraded alum/ plastic radiator with electric cooling fan, the car never overheats, with a circuit open/ closed indicator,\nA precision rebuilt mechanical advanced distributor (I have the curve graph if you are interested) and it has an Electronic ignition system (pertronix)\nBaffled oil pan (from TopEnd Performance)\nSmooth 5 speed transmission, cruises 100kms at just under 3,000rpm\nHigh volume low pressure electric fuel pump (Carter) flows through a Filter King regulator\n\n\nBrakes and Suspension upgrades;\n\nVolvo turbo callipers with BMW 10.25"" vented rotors\nRear brakes have 320i drums (they keep up with the front brakes)\nBraking bias is achieved with an 'reservoir on top' 5 series master cylinder (front and back balance is dialed in)\nHR springs lower the car a bit\nShock tower braces front and back\nRelocated optima battery in the trunk\nSpax shocks with adjustable damping front and back\n\nOther upgrades;\n\nYou will appreciate the uncluttered engine bay - the fuse box, voltage regulator, and flasher relay are under the dash and the wiring to the headlights are cleanly tucked into the fender\nMechanical & Electrical gauges in the car to monitor Oil temp & Pressure, Water temperature and charging\nNice Momo ""jackie steward' leather steering wheel\nThe interior of the car is in very, very nice condition and is largely stock except for the gauge cluster in the console, the dashboard is excellent (no cracks) the seats are nice and firm.\nYou can see in the photos the rust has taken the shock towers, aft part of the rockers, and lower part of the quarters. If this scares you, you'll be inspired when you see this; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvBHWBzzB7NyU5tIiEZHBg (a British restoration that really demystifies body work on Youtube, It' called Project Binky by Bad Obsession Motorsport)\n\nIf you deal with the rear shock towers (luckily I have 2 good replacements, included with the car) you immediately have a car that you can enjoy. You may already know what 145hp feels like in a 2,000lbs car, it's spritely and loads of fun.\nFor the repair of the shock tower I was quoted about 10hrs a side, I can provide contact information for Terry who is accustomed to working on these cars and has a few 2002's of his own including his beloved Tii.\nClean up the rockers, quarters behind the wheel and other usual areas. And you have an amazing car for about the price of a used Toyota...\n\nThe body work is easily doable and this car will reward you with many nice details and upgrades the car is mechanically sound and many parts of the body are very good.\n\nI have reams of useful parts that will be sold with car, including stock parts, trims and wheel etc.\n\nPlus many other great features that only a car with an enthusiastic and committed owner would ever do. Folks, this car was my car and serious hobby (obsession) for 20 plus years so you'll be getting lots of neat stuff and a legacy of care and attention lavished on a car that just needs a new home.\n\nRegards,\nJordan"

I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape.

It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day. Again, this is an ice racing car.\n\nPlease email me with any questions!\nThank you."

His wife drove it for a few summers and I bought it from them. It's never seen snow or salt from what I understand. I have owned it for almost 3 years now.\n\nI really don't need to sell this. As stated, some of my other hobbies have been taking more of my time and this has been on the back burner. I know what it's worth to me. I'm open to offers, but don't bother lowballing me. I may be interested in trades for an older Suburban or other larger SUV or framebuilding equipment (TIG welder, small mill, frame jig, etc).\n\nText any time or call me in the evenings (weekdays are best)"

northern_WI,https://eauclaire.craigslist.org/cto/d/bmw-e30-fully-prepped-iira/6469867133.html,"Hello all,\nI'm selling an E30, which has been fully prepped to be an ice racing car. It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day. Again, this is an ice racing car.\n\nPlease email me with any questions!\nThank you."

wausau,https://eauclaire.craigslist.org/cto/d/bmw-e30-fully-prepped-iira/6469867133.html,"Hello all,\nI'm selling an E30, which has been fully prepped to be an ice racing car. It's a 325is\n\nMyself and a friend bought the car last year from a well known local ice racer. Unfortunately, we haven't had time to race since picking the car up. I need to free up garage space, so I'm listing the car for sale.\n\nIt runs and drives just fine, and I'd say it's ready to ice race. You'd probably want to look over some various maintenance items such as fluids and whatnot. I should mention now that the car is sold AS IS. It's a PROJECT, it is a RACE CAR. I don't suggest driving this home. It's incredibly loud, and still definitely has issues and uncertainties. It's weight stripped and has suffered some battle scars from ice racing.\n\nHere are some facts, whether good or bad:\n\nIt's a 1984 BMW 325is Coupe.\nIt has a clean title, I can sign it over to you. It's got license plates for MN.\nIt was in a movie - how neat is that? Pictures attached.\nThe drivetrain works well. The car runs and drives - starts well each time.\nIt's a five speed manual.\nClutch seems good.\nIt has a welded differential.\nIt had a ""chip"" which apparently mildly increases the horsepower and increases the red line RPM.\nIt has a Sparco racing seat.\nIt has a full roll cage.\nIt has a quick release window net.\nIt has a quick release MOMO steering wheel.\nIt has aftermarket long tube headers.\nIt has a shifter made of a flashlight. It's hilarious.\nIt's got a header-dump style exhaust. It's LOUD and sounds awesome. We have some exhaust parts we will throw in with the vehicle.\nIt has a plastic fuel cell in the trunk.\nThree of the four headlights work.\nAs far as I am aware, all of the taillights and signals work.\nIt has some fancy aftermarket gauges.\nIt's passed tech inspections for a IIRA, it's a licensed car for ice racing.\nThe car is banged up, that should be expected of an ice racing car. Someone at one point collided with the driver's side. None of the panels are in great shape.\nIt doesn't have side windows apart from the quarter windows.\nIt has BMW BBS wheels, the ROAD tires which are on it are in rough shape. I don't have studded/ice tires for sale.\nIt has Eibach suspension components.\nIt has an electric fan wired in.\nThe car is weight stripped, but most of the features still work, such as power sunroof, etc.\nIt has a killswitch.\nETC.\n\nThis car is located in Balsam Lake, WI. It's at my family's garage.\nI live in the Twin Cities - I'm happy to show the car to you in Balsam Lake. It's easiest for me to be in WI on weekends.\n\nTHIS IS AN ICE RACING CAR.\nPlease don't expect to restore this car, or drive it every day. Again, this is an ice racing car.\n\nPlease email me with any questions!\nThank you."

comox_valley,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/rds/cto/d/i-bmw-e12-manual/6476421458.html,"The car was imported from USA very early in it's life and been in BC since.\n\nOver $8000 worth of parts and labour were poured into this car. This is not your average old BMW on Craigslist that everyone says is ""mint"", or ""just needs TLC"", or ""perfect"", ""needs nothing"" etc. I hate those ads, and I hate when people waste my time by telling me that, then I go see the car, and it's junk. In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

This is not your average old BMW on Craigslist that everyone says is ""mint"", or ""just needs TLC"", or ""perfect"", ""needs nothing"" etc. I hate those ads, and I hate when people waste my time by telling me that, then I go see the car, and it's junk. In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

This car is a great opportunity to own a part of automotive history. It needs a owner who is willing to put a bit of time and effort into some body work, the car will reward you with many positive attributes like a clean interior and strong mechanicals. This car, when cleaned up would fetch a significantly higher price. Read on and see for yourself, the fundamentals are good and this is car with many features.\n\nI have had the car since 1995, and have used it as my sole transportation for most of those years and drive it daily until recently, its true though, I live less than 10 kms from work.\n\nIn 2011'ish I rear-ended a Miata, I wasn't going quickly so the damage was confined. The insurance company replaced the hood, kidney, front nose clip, radiator (plastic alum upgrade) and electric fan, no other damage, the fender did to sustain even a stress fracture.\n\nIt's a special car with many 'period' upgrades and thoughtful details. It was restored between 2001 and 2002, so the body was straight and rust free in those days with new rubber, door seals, seal around the lights, trunk etc. I removed the reflectors and door bumpers strips and collapsed the bumper shocks so the bumper are close to the body giving the car a more 'Euro spec look' and I added euro turn signals. The car was 'jadegrun' from the factory and remains that colour.\n\n\nEngine & Drivetrain upgrades;\n\nA refined throttle linkage connects a 2bbl syncronous 38/38 downdraft with carefully selected jetting. A port matched manifold with the webbing painstakingly cut out and then powder coated\nSuper Sprint SS headers & resonator\nAggressive cam, still idles well, and pulls strongly from 2,500 up, revs freely\n10:1 compression pistons (engine built by TopEnd Performance)\nUpgraded alum/ plastic radiator with electric cooling fan, the car never overheats, with a circuit open/ closed indicator,\nA precision rebuilt mechanical advanced distributor (I have the curve graph if you are interested) and it has an Electronic ignition system (pertronix)\nBaffled oil pan (from TopEnd Performance)\nSmooth 5 speed transmission, cruises 100kms at just under 3,000rpm\nHigh volume low pressure electric fuel pump (Carter) flows through a Filter King regulator\n\n\nBrakes and Suspension upgrades;\n\nVolvo turbo callipers with BMW 10.25"" vented rotors\nRear brakes have 320i drums (they keep up with the front brakes)\nBraking bias is achieved with an 'reservoir on top' 5 series master cylinder (front and back balance is dialed in)\nHR springs lower the car a bit\nShock tower braces front and back\nRelocated optima battery in the trunk\nSpax shocks with adjustable damping front and back\n\nOther upgrades;\n\nYou will appreciate the uncluttered engine bay - the fuse box, voltage regulator, and flasher relay are under the dash and the wiring to the headlights are cleanly tucked into the fender\nMechanical & Electrical gauges in the car to monitor Oil temp & Pressure, Water temperature and charging\nNice Momo ""jackie steward' leather steering wheel\nThe interior of the car is in very, very nice condition and is largely stock except for the gauge cluster in the console, the dashboard is excellent (no cracks) the seats are nice and firm.\nYou can see in the photos the rust has taken the shock towers, aft part of the rockers, and lower part of the quarters. If this scares you, you'll be inspired when you see this; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvBHWBzzB7NyU5tIiEZHBg (a British restoration that really demystifies body work on Youtube, It' called Project Binky by Bad Obsession Motorsport)\n\nIf you deal with the rear shock towers (luckily I have 2 good replacements, included with the car) you immediately have a car that you can enjoy. You may already know what 145hp feels like in a 2,000lbs car, it's spritely and loads of fun.\nFor the repair of the shock tower I was quoted about 10hrs a side, I can provide contact information for Terry who is accustomed to working on these cars and has a few 2002's of his own including his beloved Tii.\nClean up the rockers, quarters behind the wheel and other usual areas. And you have an amazing car for about the price of a used Toyota...\n\nThe body work is easily doable and this car will reward you with many nice details and upgrades the car is mechanically sound and many parts of the body are very good.\n\nI have reams of useful parts that will be sold with car, including stock parts, trims and wheel etc.\n\nPlus many other great features that only a car with an enthusiastic and committed owner would ever do. Folks, this car was my car and serious hobby (obsession) for 20 plus years so you'll be getting lots of neat stuff and a legacy of care and attention lavished on a car that just needs a new home.\n\nRegards,\nJordan"

If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

kelowna_/_okanagan,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/nvn/cto/d/my-beautiful-imperfect-1976/6461359873.html,"1976 BMW 2002, 4-cyl. 1990cc/145hp 2bbl\n\nMy beautiful imperfect '02 is up for sale. This car is a great opportunity to own a part of automotive history. It needs a owner who is willing to put a bit of time and effort into some body work, the car will reward you with many positive attributes like a clean interior and strong mechanicals. This car, when cleaned up would fetch a significantly higher price. Read on and see for yourself, the fundamentals are good and this is car with many features.\n\nI have had the car since 1995, and have used it as my sole transportation for most of those years and drive it daily until recently, its true though, I live less than 10 kms from work.\n\nIn 2011'ish I rear-ended a Miata, I wasn't going quickly so the damage was confined. The insurance company replaced the hood, kidney, front nose clip, radiator (plastic alum upgrade) and electric fan, no other damage, the fender did to sustain even a stress fracture.\n\nIt's a special car with many 'period' upgrades and thoughtful details. It was restored between 2001 and 2002, so the body was straight and rust free in those days with new rubber, door seals, seal around the lights, trunk etc. I removed the reflectors and door bumpers strips and collapsed the bumper shocks so the bumper are close to the body giving the car a more 'Euro spec look' and I added euro turn signals. The car was 'jadegrun' from the factory and remains that colour.\n\n\nEngine & Drivetrain upgrades;\n\nA refined throttle linkage connects a 2bbl syncronous 38/38 downdraft with carefully selected jetting. A port matched manifold with the webbing painstakingly cut out and then powder coated\nSuper Sprint SS headers & resonator\nAggressive cam, still idles well, and pulls strongly from 2,500 up, revs freely\n10:1 compression pistons (engine built by TopEnd Performance)\nUpgraded alum/ plastic radiator with electric cooling fan, the car never overheats, with a circuit open/ closed indicator,\nA precision rebuilt mechanical advanced distributor (I have the curve graph if you are interested) and it has an Electronic ignition system (pertronix)\nBaffled oil pan (from TopEnd Performance)\nSmooth 5 speed transmission, cruises 100kms at just under 3,000rpm\nHigh volume low pressure electric fuel pump (Carter) flows through a Filter King regulator\n\n\nBrakes and Suspension upgrades;\n\nVolvo turbo callipers with BMW 10.25"" vented rotors\nRear brakes have 320i drums (they keep up with the front brakes)\nBraking bias is achieved with an 'reservoir on top' 5 series master cylinder (front and back balance is dialed in)\nHR springs lower the car a bit\nShock tower braces front and back\nRelocated optima battery in the trunk\nSpax shocks with adjustable damping front and back\n\nOther upgrades;\n\nYou will appreciate the uncluttered engine bay - the fuse box, voltage regulator, and flasher relay are under the dash and the wiring to the headlights are cleanly tucked into the fender\nMechanical & Electrical gauges in the car to monitor Oil temp & Pressure, Water temperature and charging\nNice Momo ""jackie steward' leather steering wheel\nThe interior of the car is in very, very nice condition and is largely stock except for the gauge cluster in the console, the dashboard is excellent (no cracks) the seats are nice and firm.\nYou can see in the photos the rust has taken the shock towers, aft part of the rockers, and lower part of the quarters. If this scares you, you'll be inspired when you see this; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvBHWBzzB7NyU5tIiEZHBg (a British restoration that really demystifies body work on Youtube, It' called Project Binky by Bad Obsession Motorsport)\n\nIf you deal with the rear shock towers (luckily I have 2 good replacements, included with the car) you immediately have a car that you can enjoy. You may already know what 145hp feels like in a 2,000lbs car, it's spritely and loads of fun.\nFor the repair of the shock tower I was quoted about 10hrs a side, I can provide contact information for Terry who is accustomed to working on these cars and has a few 2002's of his own including his beloved Tii.\nClean up the rockers, quarters behind the wheel and other usual areas. And you have an amazing car for about the price of a used Toyota...\n\nThe body work is easily doable and this car will reward you with many nice details and upgrades the car is mechanically sound and many parts of the body are very good.\n\nI have reams of useful parts that will be sold with car, including stock parts, trims and wheel etc.\n\nPlus many other great features that only a car with an enthusiastic and committed owner would ever do. Folks, this car was my car and serious hobby (obsession) for 20 plus years so you'll be getting lots of neat stuff and a legacy of care and attention lavished on a car that just needs a new home.\n\nRegards,\nJordan"

This is not your average old BMW on Craigslist that everyone says is ""mint"", or ""just needs TLC"", or ""perfect"", ""needs nothing"" etc. I hate those ads, and I hate when people waste my time by telling me that, then I go see the car, and it's junk. In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

This is not your average old BMW on Craigslist that everyone says is ""mint"", or ""just needs TLC"", or ""perfect"", ""needs nothing"" etc. I hate those ads, and I hate when people waste my time by telling me that, then I go see the car, and it's junk. In the interest of transparency, I have included pictures of the problem spots on this car, so you don't have your time wasted. This car is NOT ""mint"", it does need TLC, but I have laid out exactly what it needs. I don't want to waste your time, and I hope you won't waste mine.\n\nFor sale is a 1981 BMW 528i. If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

This car is a great opportunity to own a part of automotive history. It needs a owner who is willing to put a bit of time and effort into some body work, the car will reward you with many positive attributes like a clean interior and strong mechanicals. This car, when cleaned up would fetch a significantly higher price. Read on and see for yourself, the fundamentals are good and this is car with many features.\n\nI have had the car since 1995, and have used it as my sole transportation for most of those years and drive it daily until recently, its true though, I live less than 10 kms from work.\n\nIn 2011'ish I rear-ended a Miata, I wasn't going quickly so the damage was confined. The insurance company replaced the hood, kidney, front nose clip, radiator (plastic alum upgrade) and electric fan, no other damage, the fender did to sustain even a stress fracture.\n\nIt's a special car with many 'period' upgrades and thoughtful details. It was restored between 2001 and 2002, so the body was straight and rust free in those days with new rubber, door seals, seal around the lights, trunk etc. I removed the reflectors and door bumpers strips and collapsed the bumper shocks so the bumper are close to the body giving the car a more 'Euro spec look' and I added euro turn signals. The car was 'jadegrun' from the factory and remains that colour.\n\n\nEngine & Drivetrain upgrades;\n\nA refined throttle linkage connects a 2bbl syncronous 38/38 downdraft with carefully selected jetting. A port matched manifold with the webbing painstakingly cut out and then powder coated\nSuper Sprint SS headers & resonator\nAggressive cam, still idles well, and pulls strongly from 2,500 up, revs freely\n10:1 compression pistons (engine built by TopEnd Performance)\nUpgraded alum/ plastic radiator with electric cooling fan, the car never overheats, with a circuit open/ closed indicator,\nA precision rebuilt mechanical advanced distributor (I have the curve graph if you are interested) and it has an Electronic ignition system (pertronix)\nBaffled oil pan (from TopEnd Performance)\nSmooth 5 speed transmission, cruises 100kms at just under 3,000rpm\nHigh volume low pressure electric fuel pump (Carter) flows through a Filter King regulator\n\n\nBrakes and Suspension upgrades;\n\nVolvo turbo callipers with BMW 10.25"" vented rotors\nRear brakes have 320i drums (they keep up with the front brakes)\nBraking bias is achieved with an 'reservoir on top' 5 series master cylinder (front and back balance is dialed in)\nHR springs lower the car a bit\nShock tower braces front and back\nRelocated optima battery in the trunk\nSpax shocks with adjustable damping front and back\n\nOther upgrades;\n\nYou will appreciate the uncluttered engine bay - the fuse box, voltage regulator, and flasher relay are under the dash and the wiring to the headlights are cleanly tucked into the fender\nMechanical & Electrical gauges in the car to monitor Oil temp & Pressure, Water temperature and charging\nNice Momo ""jackie steward' leather steering wheel\nThe interior of the car is in very, very nice condition and is largely stock except for the gauge cluster in the console, the dashboard is excellent (no cracks) the seats are nice and firm.\nYou can see in the photos the rust has taken the shock towers, aft part of the rockers, and lower part of the quarters. If this scares you, you'll be inspired when you see this; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvBHWBzzB7NyU5tIiEZHBg (a British restoration that really demystifies body work on Youtube, It' called Project Binky by Bad Obsession Motorsport)\n\nIf you deal with the rear shock towers (luckily I have 2 good replacements, included with the car) you immediately have a car that you can enjoy. You may already know what 145hp feels like in a 2,000lbs car, it's spritely and loads of fun.\nFor the repair of the shock tower I was quoted about 10hrs a side, I can provide contact information for Terry who is accustomed to working on these cars and has a few 2002's of his own including his beloved Tii.\nClean up the rockers, quarters behind the wheel and other usual areas. And you have an amazing car for about the price of a used Toyota...\n\nThe body work is easily doable and this car will reward you with many nice details and upgrades the car is mechanically sound and many parts of the body are very good.\n\nI have reams of useful parts that will be sold with car, including stock parts, trims and wheel etc.\n\nPlus many other great features that only a car with an enthusiastic and committed owner would ever do. Folks, this car was my car and serious hobby (obsession) for 20 plus years so you'll be getting lots of neat stuff and a legacy of care and attention lavished on a car that just needs a new home.\n\nRegards,\nJordan"

If you're a Bimmerhead, you know this is not only the final model year of the e12 5 series, this is the best one. 265 Getrag 5 speed transmission, LH-Jetronic engine management attached to a 180hp 2.8L straight 6 M30 engine, these were exceptionally good cars.\n\nThis example is what I describe as extremely low rust, as I don't believe there are any ""rust free"" e12's in this part of the world. When purchased, the fenders and valance were rotten, but have been replaced with California sourced used parts. While the fenders were off, the inners were treated with POR15, so they won't rust again.\n\nThe car has 75k miles on it, runs great, and has a TON of new parts. Full Service Inspection II was performed, including ALL fluids, plugs, wires, cap, rotor, ALL filters, valve adjustment, etc. During the inspection process, some items were noted deficient, and repaired as needed. This includes oil pan gasket, engine mounts, small plate on back of cylinder head, air intake boot at throttle body, fuel hoses in engine bay, hazard warning switch, wiper switch/relay, water pump, thermostat, all drive belts, differential mount, trans mount, rebuilt driveshaft, rear brakes, control arms, tie rods, idler arm, steering column coupler, fan clutch, sanded and painted front crossmember, etc. I'm sure there are some things I am forgetting, but you get the idea. This car is owned by a long time BMW enthusiast, and was serviced accordingly. Just put a used Bosal exhaust in it as well.\n\nOther items of note are the E30 sport seats installed using custom seat brackets, E31 forged alloy wheels, good 205/55/16 Hankook tires, brand new Bilstein Sport shocks and struts with Intrax lowering springs.\n\nItems that will need attention are the sunroof, as seen in the pics, interior, hand brake needs to be hooked up, speedo cable snapped while it was being worked o. It also has AC, but doesn't work, and has no radio. The other pics will speak for themselves, I believe. It was registered and I was driving it regularly until 22nd Jan. Plates just expired. Reason for selling, I have another project on the go and I need space.\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I can answer them no problem."

victoria,https://vancouver.craigslist.ca/nvn/cto/d/my-beautiful-imperfect-1976/6461359873.html,"1976 BMW 2002, 4-cyl. 1990cc/145hp 2bbl\n\nMy beautiful imperfect '02 is up for sale. This car is a great opportunity to own a part of automotive history. It needs a owner who is willing to put a bit of time and effort into some body work, the car will reward you with many positive attributes like a clean interior and strong mechanicals. This car, when cleaned up would fetch a significantly higher price. Read on and see for yourself, the fundamentals are good and this is car with many features.\n\nI have had the car since 1995, and have used it as my sole transportation for most of those years and drive it daily until recently, its true though, I live less than 10 kms from work.\n\nIn 2011'ish I rear-ended a Miata, I wasn't going quickly so the damage was confined. The insurance company replaced the hood, kidney, front nose clip, radiator (plastic alum upgrade) and electric fan, no other damage, the fender did to sustain even a stress fracture.\n\nIt's a special car with many 'period' upgrades and thoughtful details. It was restored between 2001 and 2002, so the body was straight and rust free in those days with new rubber, door seals, seal around the lights, trunk etc. I removed the reflectors and door bumpers strips and collapsed the bumper shocks so the bumper are close to the body giving the car a more 'Euro spec look' and I added euro turn signals. The car was 'jadegrun' from the factory and remains that colour.\n\n\nEngine & Drivetrain upgrades;\n\nA refined throttle linkage connects a 2bbl syncronous 38/38 downdraft with carefully selected jetting. A port matched manifold with the webbing painstakingly cut out and then powder coated\nSuper Sprint SS headers & resonator\nAggressive cam, still idles well, and pulls strongly from 2,500 up, revs freely\n10:1 compression pistons (engine built by TopEnd Performance)\nUpgraded alum/ plastic radiator with electric cooling fan, the car never overheats, with a circuit open/ closed indicator,\nA precision rebuilt mechanical advanced distributor (I have the curve graph if you are interested) and it has an Electronic ignition system (pertronix)\nBaffled oil pan (from TopEnd Performance)\nSmooth 5 speed transmission, cruises 100kms at just under 3,000rpm\nHigh volume low pressure electric fuel pump (Carter) flows through a Filter King regulator\n\n\nBrakes and Suspension upgrades;\n\nVolvo turbo callipers with BMW 10.25"" vented rotors\nRear brakes have 320i drums (they keep up with the front brakes)\nBraking bias is achieved with an 'reservoir on top' 5 series master cylinder (front and back balance is dialed in)\nHR springs lower the car a bit\nShock tower braces front and back\nRelocated optima battery in the trunk\nSpax shocks with adjustable damping front and back\n\nOther upgrades;\n\nYou will appreciate the uncluttered engine bay - the fuse box, voltage regulator, and flasher relay are under the dash and the wiring to the headlights are cleanly tucked into the fender\nMechanical & Electrical gauges in the car to monitor Oil temp & Pressure, Water temperature and charging\nNice Momo ""jackie steward' leather steering wheel\nThe interior of the car is in very, very nice condition and is largely stock except for the gauge cluster in the console, the dashboard is excellent (no cracks) the seats are nice and firm.\nYou can see in the photos the rust has taken the shock towers, aft part of the rockers, and lower part of the quarters. If this scares you, you'll be inspired when you see this; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHvBHWBzzB7NyU5tIiEZHBg (a British restoration that really demystifies body work on Youtube, It' called Project Binky by Bad Obsession Motorsport)\n\nIf you deal with the rear shock towers (luckily I have 2 good replacements, included with the car) you immediately have a car that you can enjoy. You may already know what 145hp feels like in a 2,000lbs car, it's spritely and loads of fun.\nFor the repair of the shock tower I was quoted about 10hrs a side, I can provide contact information for Terry who is accustomed to working on these cars and has a few 2002's of his own including his beloved Tii.\nClean up the rockers, quarters behind the wheel and other usual areas. And you have an amazing car for about the price of a used Toyota...\n\nThe body work is easily doable and this car will reward you with many nice details and upgrades the car is mechanically sound and many parts of the body are very good.\n\nI have reams of useful parts that will be sold with car, including stock parts, trims and wheel etc.\n\nPlus many other great features that only a car with an enthusiastic and committed owner would ever do. Folks, this car was my car and serious hobby (obsession) for 20 plus years so you'll be getting lots of neat stuff and a legacy of care and attention lavished on a car that just needs a new home.\n\nRegards,\nJordan"

This car has served me extremely well, and it is the most fun thing to drive in the world. However, I am looking for something different right now and I can't have two cars right now.\n\nThis E30 has been made to be fun and exciting, the reason anyone would want an E30.\n\nFirst I will start with the modifications:\n\n- Aftermarket Exhaust\n- Mishumoto Radiator\n- Short Shifter with aftermarket knob and shaft (will include original wooden knob)\n- BC Racing Coilovers (They're on the hardest setting right now, so let me know if you would like me to tune them to feel softer)\n- Aftermarket Kenwood Stereo (It's a little outdated but it still works perfectly)\n\nHere is the common work I needed done to the car:\n\n- I just replaced the starter with a Bosch one about 50 miles ago. It was just done because the old starter wasn't making the car start first try and wasn't cranking well.\n- Replaced the driver side door latch mechanism since it wasn't staying shut. I did this about 1,200 miles ago.\n- Had my brake lines replaced. They were corroding and were going to burst at any point. A Brake Line dash light lit up after doing this, but I just believe that something electrical had a screw up during the replacement. (It was done professionally) I did this about 1,400 miles ago.\n\nWork still needed:\n\n- This car has everything to pass inspection except for lights. This car's low beams work perfect, but the right low beam bracket broke and the light is being held with electrical tape. The Right High beam is also not working and I took the bulb out.

I've had this car and daily driven it for over 10 years.\n\nWe've been through a lot together and I've put countless hours under the hood with this beauty.\n\nLooking for a good new home, please understand what your getting into when you purchase one of these cars (30 years old). While I have it in good shape it does need continual TLC.\n\nI have many maintenance logs showing all the repairs and scheduled maintenance I've done over the years.\n\nHere are some of the cold hard facts about the car you'll want to know:\n\nCars Location: San Diego, California\n\nYear: 1988\n\nBody Style: 2- Door\n\nColor: Black (schwartz)\n\nTransmission: 5-Speed, Manual\n\nVIN: WBAAB5407J4286071\n\nMiles: 243,122\n\nModel: 325 (SUPER ETA) - I have done a full conversion making this a ""327i"" car. I purchased a ""885"" BimmerHeads rebuilt head. It was ported and polished, new stainless steel valves, HD rockers, 272 Billet Cam, new Valve springs. it had THE WORKS. This was installed in June of 2017. So it's VERY FRESH\n\nAlong with the head: I installed the larger intake manifold and had it professionally powdered coated black.\n\nInstalled all new coolant hoses (blue silicon)\n\nInstalled a 325i refurbished MAF, 325i Throttle Body and TPS\n\n17.5 LBS M50 injectors which I had fully rebuilt\n\n3.0 Bar Fuel Pressure Regular - brand new\n\n173 ECU with SSSquid 2.7i chip\n\n7K redline tachometer (even put in some cool looking rings)\n\nI used all new high quality gaskets etc everywhere, I took my time and it turned out very nice.\n\nNew Bremi Cap and Rotor and STI ignition wire set.\n\nSince then I've installed a rebuilt drive shaft and a new Bosch Starter.\n\nThe list goes on but you get the picture.\n\nTo further compliment the ""327i"" conversion I installed a 3.73 Diff and removed the dual mass flywheel, installing a single mass ""i"" one and had it machined down. I put a new clutch disk, pressure plate, TOB, etc in. Changed out ALL the tranny seals etc (I do a very thorough job whenever I work on this car)\n\nWheels / Tires: Ronal LS 15' - very nice wheels that are period correct. I had these imported from RONAL in Europe. Less than 2 years old with ZERO curb rash - they are in immaculate condition. They are wrapped in Direzza DZ102 205 / 55 / 15 all around with lots of life left.\n\nSuspension: H&R Race Springs with Bilstein Sport Shocks. Every bushing and mount has been replaced.\n\nSubframe mounts: new Lemforder stock rubber\nTrailing Arm bushings: new Lemforder stock rubber\nRear Shock mounts: upgraded E46 "" I believe "" rubber\nNew Rear Springs Pads\n\nNew Front Strut Bearings/mounts\nNew CAB's E30 M3 offset version\nnew sway bar bushings and links\nnew Lemforder tie rod assemblies\nNew front wheels bearings/hub assembly\n\nThe suspension is very stiff and solid - but not nasty squeaky like you'd get with polly bushings.\n\nUpgrades:\n\nAs stated above, full conversion to a 327i stroker motor, freshly rebuilt top end.\n\nReal Genuine Hartge Front and Rear Strut Bars *RARE\n\nMHW Tail Lights *RARE\n\nMtech 1 Steering Wheel\n\nX5 3.0 shifter with M weighted shift knob, Leather with M stripe shift boot\n\nE46 M3 Floor Mats\n\nBlue Silicon Coolant/Radiator Hoses\n\nE34 Leather E-Brake handle\n\nE30 Leather E-Brake Boot\n\nRear Premium Speakers installed (OEM)\n\nRONAL LS Wheels (near mint condition) Less than 2 years old\n\nGenuine Hartge Rear Badge (H28), also have chinese Hartge Badging.\n\nFront Euro Grills\n\nFront Blinkers Clear Smoked\n\nFront Smoked Head lights and high beams\n\nFront Euro Trim\n\nFront Vinyl Sport Seats installed, Driver is near mint condition, and passenger is all mint except a hole which i have covered with a leather patch (looks decent). All the seat shocks have been replaced.\n\nShadow Trimmed all around the windows (looks very nice)\n\nWindows tinted 35% all around (professionally done)\n\nRecent Wheel alignment\n\nMap light front an ""IS"" car\n\nEuro Clock installed\n\nPlastic Bumper Conversion\n\nFront IS lip (aftermarket)\n\nAC Delete\n\nCruse Control Delete\n\nWindshield washer system Delete\n\nBlacked out Front Kindey Grill\n\nThrottle Body Heater Delete (Done Very Nicely - makes engine compartment a lot cleaner)\n\nCD Player with AUX port\n\nMaintence :\n\nI bought this car at 133,XXX miles in 2007 and have meticulously maintained it. I have many of my personal records to show you (I did all the work myself). It's had oil changes every 3 months or 3,000 miles with Castrol GTX 20W50 every time. Fuel Filters every 10K, timing belts every few years, coolant and brake fluid changes often. Air Filters often. Valves adjust every 10K, new NKG spark plugs. Tranny fluid changed every year. Diff fluid changed often too. You name it, it's prolly been done with all high quality oils, gaskets and parts.\n\nWith that said this is a 30 year old classic and it does have a few beauty marks and a few things that need some attention.\n\nPaint: it's original and looks very good for it's age, it does of course have scratches, chips and blemishes etc\n\nFront Driver Side Fender has some damage (see pics)\n\npassenger side door has some dents (see pics)\n\nAnd the body has small little dings here and there.\n\nThe rear wheel bearings just started to make noise a few hundred miles ago and i haven't got around to replacing them.\n\nThe rear Drive axles are going. You can feel it in the driveline if you aren't smooth with the gas pedal.\n\nDash has a few cracks (very typical)\n\nDriver side door is squeaky (I have the bushing for it just haven't gotten around to installing it, part included in the sale)\n\n------------\n\nOverall this is a fantastic car, I really want to see it go to a good home. I have put hundreds of hours of blood seat, tears and $$$$ into this car over the last 10+ years and want to find someone who will appreciate it and make it even better than it is now.\n\nI will have it smoged for you before sale if you so desire.\n\nClean Title, Tags registered until March 2018, Car has lived in California it's whole life.\n\nPrice: $10,650 OBO, Cash and only Cash\n\nCall or Text: show contact info\n\nThanks"

Castro wouldn't install junk parts though. S52 tranny has around 130k.\n\nCar is a great daily and all around fun car but you swap out to race tires you can have a track ready car too.\n\nFor those who don't know what a S52 is, that is the motor in the 96 to 99 E36 M3 motor. It's rated at 240hp to the flywheel and being in a lighter chassis like the E30, it's really quick and agile.\n\nHighlights...\n\n-CLEAN TITLE! -all panels have original vin including bumpers! -BAR legal. yes the swap is smog legal!!!! -New clutch when s52 was installed with single mass flywheel -Quick as hell! E36 powertrain in a lighter chassis -S52 motor with S50 intake. low miles\n-Z3 1.9L steering rack. linear control and VERY responsive. 2.7 turns lock to lock vs stock 4 turns!!! -2.93 LSD-***WORKING AC, HEAT and even cruise control*** -Working gauge cluster including odometer, speedo , etc... -refurbished front seats with new ""leather"" and shocks -Ronal LS 15 inch wheels w Dunlops 205/55/15 tires.

Could be oil filter gasket, crankcast pressure vent or something else. It's not a major leak but I always do full disclosure -dash cracks but has dash cover -paint is good for age and original. not really a low but it's a not show car. still shines nicely after 30 years. -- Front spoiler and rear trunk spoiler repainted. Everything else original with some 'patina' -brake light on overhead display sometimes turns on but the brake lights do work!-needs new front headliner to hold up OBC controls -- when AC is on idle sometimes ""hunts"" -power antenna is not working -- driver's window works intermittently. I think it's the gears need lubing -- battery tray area has some corrosion. Typical e30 -- some bolt holes in trunk area. Used to have a tow hitch but I took it off to do the bumper tuck -- 1 rear radio speaker not working -- door tweeters not working - clutch chatter from lightened single mass flywheel. Small battery drain. I haven't looked for the issue. It's fine when driven daily.

The car runs great and cosmetically the interior and exterior are in great condition for its age. It has lots of miles but these cars will last 400k if they are maintained correctly.

I personally maintained the car as long as I have owned it and know it really well.\n\nHere is what I have replaced/repaired recently:\n\nI just changed the oil, filter, plugs, belts and tuned it up within the last few weeks. It has always had regular oil changes, etc.\n\nWithin the last 6 months, I installed a new radiator and a new water pump.\n\nWithin the last year, I replaced the rear end differential and installed a new battery.\n\nWithin the last 1.5 years, I replaced the in-line interior fuel pump, exterior fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel pump relay switch, a number of fuel hoses, the oxygen sensor and brake pads.\n\nAt some point with the last couple of years, the master cylinder was replaced and both rear drums were replaced.\n\nI can't think of anything that needs to be done to the car right now - it is in great shape. Clean title and current registration.\n\nEmail me if interested and we can schedule a time to see it. Asking $3450.\n\nThanks."
